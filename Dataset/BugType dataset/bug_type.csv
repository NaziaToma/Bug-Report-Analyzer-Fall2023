"[Task Description] Copy-paste from other applications into task description is erratic: text often gets weird ""decorations"" around it, and breaks synchronization","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Steps to reproduce:

Copy-pasted text from another application (Firefox, konsole, ...) into task description


Actual results:

On occasion text acquires weird ""decorations"". Sometimes it's just strange colors and fonts, but sometimes its more intrusive such as a frame around the text, which interferes with further editing.
When saving changes, closing edit window and opening it again, usually the weird fonts and colors go away, but the frames stay.


Expected results:

The same thing as would have happened if I *typed* the text on the keyboard: just the text should have shown up, and nothing else!",Concurrency

firefox_93_about:preferences#sync_page.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0

Steps to reproduce:

While a login enabling a synchronization of user's supported elements is invoked – that leads to the opening of 'https://accounts.firefox.com/?context=fx_desktop_v3&entrypoint=fxa_app_menu&action=email&service=sync' –, at no time that user is consulted in order to express her/his desires in regard to the selection of these elements to be be synchronized, which is rather singular in regard to Firefox's well known ethic values aiming to empower users to make their own choices right from the beginning whenever technically and juridically possible.


Actual results:

These elements – to be seen: firefox_93_about:preferences#sync_page.png – are to be discovered too late, and those selected by default by Firefox may bring a bad surprise for the users observing them not being in accordance with their will.


Expected results:

As you may have deducted it already, it would be fair to expose these elements along with each login, so the decision of their selection can solely belong to user's own appreciation.",Concurrency
Synchronization doesn't work after password reset,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Thunderbird 102.# lacks google contacts synchronization,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:91.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/91.0

Steps to reproduce:

Setup google account in Thunderbird, imported contacts.  


Actual results:

There is no method either built-in or through available plugins to synchronize.  Any changes to contacts requires a terrible dance of export/import in both directions.  On our production systems we are staying with 91.# and using tbsync until either TB 102 or add-in tbsync is upgraded to fix this

GnuGPG: signature key synchronization missing,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Steps to reproduce:

Require GPG keys stored by Thunderbird 78.x and newer in host OS' GnuPG keyring, for credible signing of both emails and e. g. PDF documents created with LibreOffice.


Actual results:

No TB <-> OS GnuPG key synchronization option available.


Expected results:

Pre-78.x TB using 'enigmail' facilitated host OS' GnuPG system, automatically having signature keys available for both applications, TB, LibreOffice and other (obviously also applying much safer local keyring encryption!).

Thunderbird should either go back to utilizing the host OS' GnuPG system (preferred straight-forward way, also due to Thunderbird's weak local key store encryption), at least in Linux, or provide a simple means of synchronizing signature keys from/to the host OS' GnuPG keyring.

In order to enable users to apply the same credible signatures to emails, files and documents, as required (recipients will hardly accept having to verify and confirm two different keys for emails and contained documents).",Concurrency

Categories are lost in Lightning after synchronization,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:56.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/56.0
Build ID: 20170926190823

Steps to reproduce:

I use Thunderbird 52.4.0 and Lightning 5.4.4. The backend is Horde webmail with Postgres database. The calendar is an remote calendar. I tried both isc and caldav. The workstation is Windows 10.

I added a category to an event in Lightning, e.g. ""work"". The category is already known in Lightning and a colour is added to the category, e.g. blue.


Actual results:

This works fine. In the calender view a red line is shown. However after synchronization the category is lost in lightning but not in the remote calendar. When I verify the event in the webmail interface from Horde the category is there as it should be.

The category is not lost when the calendar is local.

I verified this behaviour on several workstation.

Race condition in initialization code of ssl_PushIOLayer,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160407164938

Steps to reproduce:

I am working on an application that concurrently opens HTTPS connections through libcurl 7.42.1 on NSS 3.18. I checked the source code, and the bug persists at least until 3.23.

I noticed occasional crashes during the first few HTTP connections opened by the application. The crashes happened when libcurl attempted to call function pointers that were supposed to have been initialized by ssl_SetupIOMethods.

I eventually produced a multi-threaded core dump that showed that the crashing thread had proceeded past the SSL initialization code while another thread was still inside ssl_InitIOLayer, a function that is only called by ssl_PushIOLayer, where the function call is protected by double-checked locking and PR_CallOnce.

I believe that the issue is the plain Boolean variable called ssl_inited that is used for double-checked locking. The compiler is free to reorder reads and writes to plain Boolean variables, and, alas, it makes use of that freedom in my binary. Here is proof:

(gdb) l

2732 {
2733 ssl_layer_id = PR_GetUniqueIdentity(""SSL"");
2734 ssl_SetupIOMethods();
2735 ssl_inited = PR_TRUE;
2736 return PR_SUCCESS;
2737 }
2738
(gdb) p ssl_inited

=> 0x000000346f42881b <+59>: rep movsq %ds:(%rsi),%es:(%rdi)

The assembly shows that ssl_inited is set to 1 before the call to ssl_SetupIOMethods. This causes double-checked locking to fail and allows other threads to proceed while ssl_InitIOLayer is still running.

#7 0x000000346f42c6cb in ssl_PushIOLayer (ns=0x7fd48c0dd560, stack=0x7fd48c0dd500, id=-2) at sslsock.c:2746
2746 status = PR_CallOnce(&initIoLayerOnce, &ssl_InitIOLayer);
(gdb) l
2741 {
2742 PRFileDesc *layer = NULL;
2743 PRStatus status;
2744
2745 if (!ssl_inited) {
2746 status = PR_CallOnce(&initIoLayerOnce, &ssl_InitIOLayer);
2747 if (status != PR_SUCCESS)
2748 goto loser;
2749 }

The fix is to either remove ssl_inited and always call PR_CallOnce (at the cost of some performance), or make sure the compiler does not reorder accesses to ssl_inited. The best way to do the latter is platform dependant. I assume the Mozilla libraries have some utility code for this purpose (atomic Booleans and such).

Run PK11_FindSlotByName() concurrently on a single slot that always has a token inside.  In my case it was a slot that does not define the GetTokenPresent callback.


Actual results:

Occasionally PK11_FindSlotByName() spuriously fails with SEC_ERROR_NO_TOKEN.


Expected results:

PK11_FindSlotByName() should work reliably in a multi-threaded environment.",Concurrency
[autoconfig] Race condition in addOneFinishedObserver,"We're not always detecting the Exchange server.

This is due to a bug in PriorityOrderAbortable.addOneFinishedObserver(). When a success callback throws, we 

Expected result:
We issue 3 HTTP requests. We want to call the successCallback on the first successful HTTP request. But, successCallback might itself throw an exception, which should cause that request to be treated as a failure, and we need to move on to the next request. But if it succeeds, then any subsequent requests should be aborted.

Buggy situation:
HTTP request 2 finishes first. As it's not the first request, we don't call successCallback yet. However, the current code aborts HTTP request 3 anyway. HTTP request 1 then fails. We call successCallback on HTTP request 2, but that throws an exception. And we've already aborted HTTP request 3, which would have succeeded.",Concurrency
{inc} Race condition with `min-width:min-content` on `<img>` elements,"I was just investigating some testcases for Bug 1544719 and I discovered that we don't seem to honor `width:min-content` reliably -- sometimes it takes a forced incremental layout for it to take effect.

Testcase coming up.

STR:
 1. Load testcase.


EXPECTED RESULTS:
Image should be 800px wide (plus 2px border)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Image is 50px wide.


If I take additional action to trigger an incremental reflow (e.g. resizing browser horizontally, or opening devtools with F12), then the rendering switches to EXPECTED RESULTS.

Interestingly, Chrome seems to have this bug as well. I can force them to switch from ""actual"" to ""expected"" results by toggling one of the `img`'s sizing properties off and then on again, in devtools.",Concurrency
Race condition in devtools/client/framework/test/browser_about-devtools-toolbox_reload.js,"In bug 1546145, I'm changing await to be about 2x faster (each await currently creates an extra Promise, for no good reason—it's redundant—and the change is to stop doing that).

This breaks some tests, including this one.

generic-worker: command abortion race condition,"The `TestReclaimCancelledTask` integration test has picked up a race condition. See [task log lines 17620-18068](https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/KenJMiFtS0OrHC1hGyp8Zw/runs/0/logs/https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity-tc.services.mozilla.com%2Fapi%2Fqueue%2Fv1%2Ftask%2FKenJMiFtS0OrHC1hGyp8Zw%2Fruns%2F0%2Fartifacts%2Fpublic%2Flogs%2Flive.log#L17620-18068).

[This task](https://community-tc.services.mozilla.com/tasks/cbeuwcvmR7SLvA5coQiScA/runs/0/logs/https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity-tc.services.mozilla.com%2Fapi%2Fqueue%2Fv1%2Ftask%2FcbeuwcvmR7SLvA5coQiScA%2Fruns%2F0%2Fartifacts%2Fpublic%2Flogs%2Flive.log#L79-116) is created that in command 6 cancels itself. Command 7 should not run since the task abortion took place in command 6, but since command 7 has not started at that point, the abortion of command 7 has no effect, and the worker goes on to run command 7 (which sleeps for 5 mins).

The command abortion code needs some cleanup. Currently, when we discover that a task has been cancelled, we abort all commands in the task definition. We expect that only one is running, so we don't fail if a command can't be aborted (i.e. process killed) we don't expect the kill to be successful against commands that have already completed or commands that haven't run yet.

Since killing the command will result in it getting a non zero exit code, we also assume that the main thread that is executing tasks won't execute any more, since it stops after a failed command.

However, this is pretty ugly, and it lead to a race condition, despite us using a mutex around the command object when killing it.

The problem occurs when the race is won as follows:

* main thread starts command 1
* command 1 completes successfully
* abortion thread attempts to kill command 1, but sees it is not running, so continue to next command
* abortion thread tries to kill command 2 but it hasn't started, so ignores and continues...
* main thread starts command 2

The problem we see here is that the task abortion occurs precisely between command 1 completing and command 2 starting, rather than during execution of command 1. In this rare case, command 1 will not have a bad exit code, and so the main thread will schedule command 2 to run, but the kill of command 2 has already happened, so it won't get killed.

Instead the task abortion should operate at a task level, the task should be marked as aborted, its state guarded by a mutex, and the main thread should not try to execute new commands when the task has been marked for abortion.

Additionally, at any time, the task should know which was the most recent command it executed, and only if there is a command that has been started, and not completed, should the worker attempt to kill the command.

This isn't really a critical bug, since when a task is aborted, it is resolved as a failure, and expected to fail. However, it would be nice if the worker didn't consume more resources than it needed to by starting new commands when previous commands have terminated prematurely. Only artifacts of a failed task are ultimately affected, but we should still clean this up.",Concurrency
Race condition when trying to enable context menu in `mouseup` handler,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0

Steps to reproduce:

1) open any webpage
2) open console and execute following code:
```
window.addEventListener('mousedown', mouseDownHandler, true);

function mouseDownHandler(e) {
  if (e.button === 2) {
    console.log('mose down');
    e.preventDefault();
    window.addEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler, true);
    disableContextMenu(e);
  }
}

function mouseUpHandler(e) {
  enableContextMenu(e);
  window.removeEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler, true);
}

function disableContextMenu(e) {
  window.addEventListener('contextmenu', preventContextMenu, true);     // lock right-click
}

function enableContextMenu(e) {
  window.setTimeout(() => {    // executing this in the next ""tick"" of the event loop
    window.removeEventListener('contextmenu', preventContextMenu, true);  // unlock right-click
  }, 0);
}

function preventContextMenu(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.stopImmediatePropagation();
}
```
3) start pressing right mouse button (to open context menu) - press it at least 20 times (no need to hurry)


Actual results:

There is a good chance (about 10%) that the context menu will be shown even though it should be blocked.


Expected results:

The point of this code is to be able to enable context menu in the `mouseup` handler. To to this, I use `setTimeout` function to schedule execution to the next ""tick"" of the event loop - after all existing tasks and micro-tasks gets executed. I would expect this includes the internal ""mouseup"" handler used to show default context menu.

This works in Chrome.

Even though using longer timeout (like 10ms) would ""fix"" the problem, actually performing some slightly performance intensive work (like modifying DOM) in the event handler would cause the issue again, forcing you to use bigger timeout and facing race condition again and again.

The real life implication is that me as a author of ScrollAnywhere extension (and probably other scroll/gestures webextensions as well) that needs to block right click if mouse is moving but unblock it afterwards needs to use these magic delays. And in Firefox 75 the delay 10ms is suddenly not enough anymore.",Concurrency
Avoid race condition where we sample APZ transforms concurrently with updating the hit-testing tree,"With the patch from bug 1457466 I discovered a small race condition that makes the scrollbar jittery while scrolling around on http://tests.themasta.com/gibberish.txt

The problem is at [1] we run the post-swap hook concurrently with the sampler hook at [2], and this can produce unexpected results. Consider the scenario where we have an inflight scene build happening on the scene builder thread, and the built scene is sent over to the render backend thread. The RB thread also gets a GenerateFrame transaction in its queue following the built scene transaction. The scene swap happens on the RB thread, and then the RB thread continues processing its queue and does the sampling for the GenerateFrame transaction. Meanwhile, the scene builder thread got unblocked and is running the post-swap hook. If the sampling happens before the post-swap hook is done, the sampled values will be relative to the old scene, because it's the post-swap hook that updates the APZ's last-content-paint information. We need to ensure that the GenerateFrame doesn't sample until after the post-swap hook is done and APZ has the new scene information installed.

kernel32 VirtualAlloc hook jumps to invalid (not mapped) address. Race condition,"Created attachment 8994542

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.99 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Install latest Firefox available for end users. (61.0.1) ; 32-bit version, 32-bit OS 
2. Install python 2.7
3. Pip install selenium 3.12.0 (latest at the time)
4. Download latest geckodriver (0.21.0)
5.In python console:
from selenium import webdriver
driver = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path=""C:\geckodriver.exe"") (or path to the geckodriver executable)



Actual results:

It is hard to reproduce.
Initally, kernel32.dll export VirtualAlloc (VirtualAllocStub) starts with:
0:  8b ff                   mov    edi,edi
2:  55                      push   ebp
3:  89 e5                   mov    ebp,esp
5:  5d                      pop    ebp
8b ff is replaced by 2 separate writes, one byte at a time, with a detour jump:
eb f9
Execution occurred after the first byte was written and before write of the second byte:
0:  eb ff                   jmp    0x1
2:  55                      push   ebp

5:  5d                      pop    ebp

The executed instruction will be:
0:  ff 55 89                call   DWORD PTR [ebp-0x77]

[ebp-0x77] does not contain a valid pointer.

However, when I attached Windbg, it did not catch the moment in-between writes, and displayed the correct final form.
I tested with a proprietary software that can only cause delays in Firefox operations, but does not interact with it any other way. (no control-flow modifications)

Race condition on Thunderbird initial startup when opening a tab,"Steps to reproduce problem:
1. Compile Thunderbird 78 with a custom source for Owl, so that it picks up a version that actually runs in Thunderbird 78
2. Start a new profile
3. Set up an account which requires Owl to log in using a browser
4. Complete account setup
5. Dismiss the default mail dialog

Expected results: After account setup is complete, Owl logs in to the account in a tab, and discovers folders

Actual results: Exception thrown in calendar code.

What happens here is that the default mail dialog is modal, which means that Thunderbird's onload handler has not yet completed, and therefore calendar's main window onload handler has not even started to execute. However, Owl is trying to authenticate in the background by opening a browser tab. This action causes Calendar to try to update its UI, which fails because its onload handler has not yet executed.",Concurrency
Race condition between crashmover and processor when raw crashes stored on S3,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

We have an internal socorro setup (ver 263.1487279675-1) on AWS, with crashes and symbols stored on S3.

Collector passes crash over to mover and mover copies crashes to S3 and passes it to rabbitmq, processor gets if from there and on it goes.

In some small number of cases, processor gets the job before mover finished saving the data to S3 and rejects the job because raw crash can't be found.

I ""fixed"" it by adding a sleep if processor fails with CrashIDNotFound and then just trying once again. Not sure if that can be fixed in a better place or somewhere in configuration.

        try:
            raw_crash = self.source.get_raw_crash(crash_id)
            dumps = self.source.get_raw_dumps_as_files(crash_id)

Actual results:

Tracking protection blocked access to https://authedmine.com/, which backs the Coinhive Captcha and thus broke my website


Expected results:

Coinhive captcha should have worked; authedmine.com is *not* a tracker: uses no cookies or localstorage, and is the only captcha I've found on the internet that operates this way.

I wanted to use it as an alternative to reCaptcha, which installs multiple cookies on page load alone (and, ironically, is allowed to run by Tracking Protection). In its current state, Tracking Protection forces our users to use the captcha provider that does actually track them.",Concurrency

Steps to reproduce:

Start any WebRTC videoconferencing system such as meet.jit.si


Actual results:

Firefox's webrtcIndicator shows up as a system-toplevel floating window widget on an arbitrary screen location without letting me move it, with no explanation about why it needs to be there, and without letting me click through it for widgets it obscures.

The attached screenshot demonstrates how it actively prevents me from using my system toolbars/panels/taskbars/docks. This thing decided to put itself in the middle (but not even the ""exact middle"") of the top of my display, which just so happens to be where I have my taskbar/dock with launchers with GNOME Shell's ""dash to panel"" extension (otherwise, the clickable notifications widget would be what's underneath there), and so I can't even click/launch the applications underneath!


Expected results:

I understand that this widget exists as a security/privacy indicator and that it is not meant to be turned off, but there's no reason why it needs to be floating *toplevel* on an arbitrary location on my screens instead of being, say, attached prominently to every Firefox window. Besides, it just ""looks"" broken to the average user who doesn't know why things are the way they are.

[new profile] typing jank.mp4

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/109.0
Build ID: 20221120214001


### Basic Information

Steps to Reproduce:
1. In a new profile, install [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) (currently 1.45.2).
2. Subscribe [uBlock-Origin-dev-filter – All Search Engines – Global](https://github.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter#import-into-ublock-origin). (Or import [this permalink url](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quenhus/uBlock-Origin-dev-filter/7d76850954a2bbcfea9919584c101aff033cc5ed/dist/all_search_engines/global.txt) from uBO settings > Filter lists)
3. Go to https://www.google.com/search?q=f. (So it skips the seemingly unaffected search field at google.com homepage.)
4. Press and hold a key to type rapidly into google.com search field. Adding some spaces inbetween seems to make the issue worse.

Expected Results:
Typing should be smooth and there should be little janks in performance profiles.

Actual Results:
There are some janks/slowness as shown in the attached video and profiles. The situation, however, is much worse in my main profile. I will attach a video in another comment.

This issue seems to be related to google.com's autocomplete feature. If I make an extremely long search phrase, autocomplete flyout will not be activiated and the jank is gone. The jank is back after clicking the X in the search field to clear the search phrase and type again.
However, Google will temporarily suspend autocomplete (`https://www.google.com/complete/search?q=*` requests return `403`) for an unknown period of time (few hours max?) if I spam the autocomplete. I cannot reproduce the jank when autocomplete is suspended. Changing IP address or set up a new profile may lift the suspension.

Expected results:

The videos should not have played until their tabs had been selected/active.

SonicWALL Firewall Appliance with Gateway Anti-Virus is currently blocking the 64-bit stub installer,"[Preconditions]:
  - SonicWALL Firewall Appliance has to be installed and active:
    https://www.sonicwall.com/products/sonicwall-nsa/
  - The ""Gateway Anti-Virus"" option needs to be enabled for SonicWALL.

[Affected versions]: 
  all

[Affected platforms]: 
  Windows (all)

[Steps to reproduce]:
  1. Download the following 64-bit stub installer:
     https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8805254
  2. Run the stub installer as administrator.
  3. Follow the setup wizard's steps to install Firefox.

[Expected result]: 
  Firefox is successfully installed via stub installer.

[Actual result]:
  - The stub installer hangs in the ""Downloading Firefox"" stage for a
    while and then the following alert is displayed:

       Gateway Anti-Virus Alert [...] This request is blocked by the
       Firewall Gateway Anti-Virus Service. Name: InstallCore.A_237
       (Adware) blocked.

  - As a result, the stub installer is blocked from downloading
    Firefox and the install process is cancelled.

[Regression range]: 
  This issue is not a regression.

[Additional notes]:
  - We are using SonicWALL Firewall Appliance in all of our offices,
    but for one of them we've recently enabled a specific option:
    Gateway Anti-Virus.
	
     - Based on a few tests across different offices, we concluded that
       only the office that had Gateway Anti-Virus enabled was showing
       this problem.
	
     - Initially, we've noticed that suddenly both 32-bit and 64-bit
       stub installers were being blocked.
	
     - Starting last Thursday and without any changes being made to our
       office's firewall rules, we noticed that 32-bit installers were
       no longer being blocked and I've double-checked that again today.
       As of this moment, only 64-bit stub installers get blocked, with
       the same alert notification.
	
  - These are the stub installers we've used to test the firewall's 
    behavior:

     - 64-bit (blocked):
        * https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/attachment.cgi?id=8805254

     - 32-bit (initially blocked, but now they're not):
        * https://mzl.la/2eXc5VD
        * https://mzl.la/19V7f56
        * https://mzl.la/2fyuVAG 
        * https://mzl.la/2g7bQcV

  - We tested the same firewall setup with other stub/web installers,
    to see whether it's something isolated to the Firefox stub:

     - Google Chrome: not blocked
     - Opera: blocked, reason: MalAgent.I_12705 (Trojan)
     - Torch: not blocked
     - Pale Moon: not blocked
     - Vivaldi: n/a, no web installer available

     - Yandex: n/a, no web installer available

[Content Blocking] Cookies label is not changing in Strict,"[Affected versions]
latest Nightly 68.0a1

[Affected platforms]
Windows 10 x64
macOS 10.13
Ubuntu 16.04 x64

[Steps to reproduce]
1. Go to about:config
2. Set pref browser.contentblocking.features.strict to -tp,tpPrivate,cookieBehavior1,cm,fp
3. Try setting cookieBehaviour from 1 to 4
4. Go to Content Blocking from the Hamburger menu

[Expected result]
For each value to specific cookie message should be shown (as in the dropdown from Custom):
""cookieBehavior1"": cookie behaviour BEHAVIOR_REJECT_FOREIGN
""cookieBehavior2"": cookie behaviour BEHAVIOR_REJECT
""cookieBehavior3"": cookie behaviour BEHAVIOR_LIMIT_FOREIGN
""cookieBehavior4"": cookie behaviour BEHAVIOR_REJECT_TRACKER

[Actual result]
For each value from 1 to 4, the label ""Third-party tracking cookies"" remains

The issue only happens in Strict, for value 0 the behavior is as expected.",Concurrency
Popup blocking is broken,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0

Steps to reproduce:

- Enable e10
- Go to http://www.popuptest.com/ and run any test
- Once a popup is shown navigate to another site

This happens both in Firefox Reality and Fenix including the current Fennec Nightly.


Actual results:

Steps to reproduce:

The setting `lockPref(""privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown"", true);` in my mozilla.cfg is used (this is the only setting). Launch Firefox in the command line, opening the Twitter homepage: `firefox twitter.com`.


Actual results:

Firefox is launched, but the Twitter homepage is not opened.


Expected results:

The Twitter homepage should have opened.

The culprit is confirmed by me and several people on Reddit to be the setting `privacy.sanitize.sanitizeOnShutdown`--when it's set to true, many (but not all, apparently) URLs cannot be opened if they are specified as arguments to Firefox when launching it from the command line. Simply setting it to false or commenting it out will restore the expected behavior.",Concurrency

2. In the first tab click on shield icon and turn off Trackers Protection.
3. In the second tab click on shield icon and turn on Trackers Protection.
4. In the first tab click again on the shield icon and observe the blocked trackers.
5. Check the same thing in the second tab.

**Expected result**
* 4. Social Media Trackers are displayed in the ""Blocked"" section.
* 5. Social Media Trackers are displayed in the ""Blocked"" section
 
**Actual result**
* 4. Social Media Trackers are displayed in the ""Blocked"" section.
* 5. Social Media Trackers are displayed in the ""None Detected"" section. 

**Regression range**
* I don't think this is a regression. 

**Additional notes**
* After the page is refresh, Social Media Trackers are moved to ""None Detected"" section. 
* This bug is reproducing on multiple sites: Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram etc. 
* This issue is reproducing when you change the setting from about:preferences#privacy, too:

STR:
 1. In Firefox Preferences ""Privacy & Security"", toggle Content Blocking to ""Off""

 3. Click the site badge (e.g. the lock icon) at left of URL bar.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
The site-ID doorhanger ""Content Blocking | Disabled"" badge is awkwardly misaligned. In particular:
 - Within its red background, there's very little padding above the text, and lots of padding below the text. (not sure it's CSS padding; I'm just describing it visually as ""padding""
 - The triangle-exclamation-point icon is slightly lower than the text.  It looks like it wants to be baseline-aligned, but isn't quite aligned.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
 - The ""Disabled"" text should probably be one or two pixels lower, to be vertically centered in the red area & to be baseline-aligned with the icon.",Concurrency

"[Content Blocking] The ""Allow on any site"" functionality from the Permissions Doorhanger prompt does not Work","[Affected versions]
Firefox 65.0a1

[Affected platforms]
Ubuntu 16.04, Windows 7/10, Mac OS 10.13

[Steps to reproduce]
1. Open the Firefox browser and Set the following preferences in about:config
* Make sure dom.storage_access.enabled is TRUE (default in Nightly)
* Make sure urlclassifier.trackingAnnotationTable.testEntries is set to ""storage-access.englehardt-tracker.com,imminent-archeology.glitch.me"".
* Make sure network.cookie.cookieBehavior is 4 (default in Nightly)
* Make sure dom.storage_access.auto_grants is FALSE 

2. Reach https://storage-access.englehardt-tracker.com/index.html and Click anywhere on the page.
3. Reach https://imminent-archeology.glitch.me/ and Click anywhere on the page.
4. Reach https://senglehardt.com/test/storage_access/ and click the ""call document.requestStorageAccess"".
5. Click the ""Allow on Any site"" button from the Permissions Prompt.
6. Reach https://ehsanakhgari.org/test/storage_access/ and click the ""Set and Get cookie via document.cookie""



[Expected result]
Since its the same Tracker and it has been allowed on any site, the user should be able to Set and get Cookies on both https://ehsanakhgari.org/test/storage_access/ , https://senglehardt.com/test/storage_access/ 

[Actual result]
The same tracker and cookie are not allowed on other websites after the user selects the ""Allow on any site"" from the Permissions Doorhanger panel.",Concurrency
Standard content blocking is highlighted regardless of what option is selected,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Load ""about:preferences#privacy""
2. Under ""Content Blocking"", select strict or custom
3. Reload the page


Actual results:

The standard option is highlighted and expanded.


Expected results:

Strict or custom (whichever was selected) should be highlighted and expanded.",Concurrency
[Content Blocking] Cookies' labels are no longer displayed in the Control center after a restart/opening and closing the browser,"**Affected versions**
- latest Nightly 66.0a1
- Beta 65.0b9

**Affected platforms**
- Windows 10 x64
- macOS 10.13
- Ubuntu 16.04 x64

**Steps to reproduce**
1. Launch Firefox.
2. Go to about:preferences, to the ""Content Blocking"" section from Privacy & Security
3. Click on the radio button next to ""Custom"" and check Cookies.
4. Access https://www.reddit.com/.
5. Restart the browser.
- inspect the Cookies' label inside the information panel

**Expected result**
- ""Blocking Tracking Cookies"" label is displayed in the information panel.

**Actual result**
- ""Blocking Tracking Cookies"" label is NOT displayed in the information panel.

**Regression range**
- Not a regression since I was able to reproduce it on 65.0b8  as well, when the Cookies' labels have been implemented.

**Additional notes**
- a workaround is to select another blocking level from the Cookies' drop-down menu, and then reopen the info panel.

rcwn blocking some xmlHttpRequests,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/67.0.3396.99 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Starting from version 59 Firefox sometimes can not load our app (SDL Tridion (https://www.sdl.com/software-and-services/tridion-dx/tridion-sites.html)).
Approximately every fifth reload of the page got stuck.

From our side we have found that initialization hangs because some of (cached) xhr requests never got response. It just waiting for it forever.

After long investigation we have found that after disabling rcwn (network.http.rcwn.enabled) issue never reproduces again (but it is not acceptable workaround for our customers)
Also we have found that decreasing network.http.rcwn.min_wait_before_racing_ms and network.http.rcwn.max_wait_before_racing_ms make defect more often reproducible (setting both values to 0 makes it reproducible almost every page refresh)

Not sure if it is related (most likely no, but still make sense to mention), looks like a coincidence, but all ""broken"" requests are requests to xml or xslt files.

Another interesting thing is that every time when one of the requests hangs in Web Tools (Network tab) we can see that there are 2 duplicates of the broken request (see screenshot). All three have no any information in UI except first one (it has a callstack). But in HAR (attached) we have found that first of those request always have flag ""blocked"": 1 in timings and in all repro cases in HAR file there are 6 in total requests with ""blocked"": 1 flag.
We tried to change network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server property to different values and in all repro cases amount of request with ""blocked"" flag is equal to the value of the property.

One more thing: according to about:networking#rcwn page every time when issue reproduces the counter of ""Net won count"" increases by 2 or 3. In all cases when page loads fine - ""Net won count"" never increases.

Our assumption is that requests send via rcwn mechanism never got released if they got into a blocked state because of ""network.http.max-persistent-connections-per-server"" rule.

Also we had no success on building small demo page to reproduce this issue.

Would be great if you can give us any advice on how to proceed with investigation of this issue.

Thanks,

tooltip for tracking protection/content blocking in app menu not shown,"Firefox 65+, tested with 68.0b12 and Firefox 69.0a1 20190624213657 on Windows 8.1

The tooltip for tracking protection/content blocking in the app menu is not shown.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open app menu: Click button with three vertical lines at right of toolbar.
2. Move mouse over the text ""Content blocking"".

Actual result: No tooltip

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox version 56.0.1 (64-bit)

CSP applied to iframe is interfering in parent CSP rules (even after iframe is removed)

Steps to repro:
1. Please open the attached html in Firefox. Please note that there is no img-src CSP is set to ""* data:""
2. See that it correctly loads the image
3. Click the button -> it will append an iframe to the document body with the following CSP: ""default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; connect-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self';"", and it will also append the same image that was loaded in the html


Actual results:

img is not loaded


Expected results:

img should load fine, since the CSP restriction is applied to the iframe
All other browsers (Chrome and Edge) load the image.

The bug also happens if you remove the iframe before inserting the new img tag",Concurrency

Actual results:

the page is scrolled vertically, a slight horizontal scrolling is also performed. 




Expected results:

Blocking of autoplaying videos breaks NC+ GO (TV streaming),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0

Steps to reproduce:

After updating Firefox from 69.0.3 to 70.0 none channel on ncplusgo.pl worked. 


Actual results:

The default [Firefox] setting is to block sound, but it prevents the video from playing at all (only first frame is shown). There is no way to resume the video, as it is live TV streaming.


Expected results:

With previous FF versions this feature didn't interfere with the video at all and it was played normally, as you expect on a site with live TV.  Less tech savvy  users might not know how to fix it. This site needs to get whitelisted or FF's behaviour changed.",Concurrency

Steps to reproduce:

If you create a listener like this:

browser.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
  redirect,
  {urls: [pattern], types: [""sub_frame""]},
  [""blocking""]
);

And you don't have the webRequestBlocking permission, it should fail or throw some kind of error. 


Actual results:

Instead of failing, it just doesn't block, which is confusing. Not knowing this required a specific permission, I assumed I misunderstood some async Javascript thing or something. Nope! Eventually I figured it out, but only after reading a bunch of docs.


Expected results:

It should have failed and thrown an error. Or at least just thrown an error.",Concurrency

Expected results:

Email should have been at worst scored a little higher (best case, stop using SORBS), and further anti-spam tests run to make final spam/ham determination.

Being listed by SORBS should never be used as a decision to BLOCK - scoring, maybe, but SORBS is notoriously unreliable.

The SORBS Wikipedia page describes my exact problem precisely:

""Problem
Some ISPs use a shared SMTP server to onsend their customers email. If any of those customers send emails which the system identifies as spam, then the legitimate traffic from all the other users that use that SMTP server is blocked by the system. As at May 2016, the system was flagging the Telstra Australia (Australia's largest and most reputable internet service provider) SMTP servers as a spam source, thereby blocking legitimate emails from Telstra customers being delivered to any ISP's that use the SORBS system. It is highly likely that among Telstra's hundreds of thousands of customers, there are some virus infected computers acting as zombies and relying spam emails. The SORBS system is based on a faulty analysis of the spam problem and should not be used because it blocks large quantities of legitimate emails.""

There are ton more just like this one:

https://wordtothewise.com/2010/12/gfi-sorbs-considered-harmful-part-4/

Steps to reproduce:

Tested the WebExtensions version of uBlock Origin 1.9.17b9:
https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.9.17b9



Actual results:

When loading any web page, the browser console is filled with entries like:

result is undefined WebRequest.jsm:752

	next self-hosted:1120:9
	TaskImpl_run resource://gre/modules/Task.jsm:319:42
	bound TaskImpl_run self-hosted:957:17

This is because the code at WebRequest.jsm:752 does not 1st check whether the returned value from a webRequest.onBeforeRequest listener is undefined, it assumes an Object is always returned.

However, the documentation regarding listeners for chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest et al says[1]:

> the callback can return a webRequest.BlockingResponse that determines
> the further life cycle of the request.

So as per documentation, a callback CAN return a BlockingResponse object for when a request has to be canceled or redirected. However, when no cancellation of redirection is needed, it is ok to return nothing, i.e. `undefined`.

Build ID: 20171017104524

Steps to reproduce:

After upgrading to Firefox 56, recent versions of the Cliqz extension causes Firefox >=56 to freeze completely.

The AMO version of Cliqz is not affected (currently 2.20.3), but you can get a more recent version with this link:
https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdncliqz/update/browser/Cliqz.1.21.1.xpi

After installing it on a fresh profile, you can reliably trigger the freeze by enabling/disabling Human Web:

1. Click on the Cliqz Icon (""Cliqz Control Center"")
2. Under ""Search Settings"", there is the option ""Human Web"". It should be enabled by default.
3. Disable it and re-enable it.

Repeat step 3: After 1 or 2 attempts, the whole process should completely freeze.

I can reliably reproduce it on Ubuntu with Firefox 56. It also occurs on MacOS and Windows.


Actual results:

Firefox completely freezes. I attached the backtraces taken after Firefox freezes. It looks like a deadlock. Also there is no CPU activity. 

Maybe storage::Connection::Release() causes a deadlock, as it is stuck waiting for a lock.

Firefox 55 was not affected, but the problem can be reproduced with Firefox 56. I also check with nightly and it also freezes like FF 56. The backtraces of nightly look very similar to the FF 56 backtraces that I attached.

As the problem did not occur with older versions of the Cliqz extension, there is probably a way to work around the problem. Still, from what I see, it looks like a bug in the browser that is why I report it.

Cliqz Browser 1.16.0 (which is based on Firefox 56) is also affected, while 1.15.x (Firefox 55 based) is not affected.

No Performance tab.  e.g. https://treeherder.allizom.org/#/jobs?repo=servo&selectedJob=25

Note: 
I tried uploading the same performance artifact with result=success, the Performance tab shows up.

I know that it may not make sense to look at the performance data when the test failed. But for Servo we need to show that some of the tests were timeout (with a orange job), but at the same time show the performance data from the passing tests).",Performance

Performance issues (possibly CSS animation related) in Firefox Quantum beta on OS/X - Very high CPU usage on stripe.com - Perf.html attached,"Created attachment 8917259
Firefox 2017-10-11 09.20 profile.sps.json.gz

Build ID: 20171002181526

Steps to reproduce:

This is my first bug report so bear with me :-)

I installed the Firefox Quantum beta and cleared my profile.

Firefox never was very fast on my 15 inch retina Macbook Pro, but it's gotten worse with Quantum.

I went to stripe.com as they are heavy on CSS animations / transitions. The CPU usage immediatly skyrocketed.


Actual results:

CPU usage was very high, fans started spinning. Scrolling was very janky.


Expected results:

A buttery smooth performance like I have in Safari.",Performance

PerformanceObserver CORS restrictions in WebExtensions Content scripts despite appropriate Host permissions,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:58.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/58.0

Steps to reproduce:

Created fresh profile. Added WebExtension:

manifest.json:
----
""permissions"": [
  ""<all_urls>""
],
""content_scripts"": [
  {
    ""matches"": [""<all_urls>""],
    ""js"": [""contentscript.js""],
    ""run_at"": ""document_start"",
    ""all_frames"": true

contentscript.js
----
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  list.getEntries().map(entry => {
    if (!entry.name.startsWith('https://jsfiddle.net')) {
      console.log(entry.transferSize);
    }
  });
});
observer.observe({entryTypes: ['resource']});
---

Now navigate to https://jsfiddle.net/


Actual results:

The console logs only 0


Expected results:

The console should log the actual transferSize


Note:
This is probably because of the CORS restrictions for some properties provided by PerformanceObserver, including transferSize: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/PerformanceResourceTiming/transferSize

Since Host permissions should overwrite CORS restrictions I would assume that in this case the actual transferSize is provided.",Performance
Performance drops when element highlighter is active,"Created attachment 8989169
performance.mp4

When using the element highlighter from the animation panel, the performance of the animation drops.  This effect doesn't occur when the highlighter is enabled through the rules panel.  The attached video shows the difference of both methods.

Note: might be related to high screen resolution, as I had an easy time to reproduce it on a 27"" screen, but it was harder on a 15"" screen.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Visit a website with animations, like [1]
2. Inspect the animation and select the animated element
3. Enable the element highlighter

Expected result:
- The animation should continue at least as good as when the highlighter is enabled from other places

Actual result:
- With the highlighter enabled through the animation inspector, the performance drops.  The effect seems to be stronger on higher screen resolutions, though it is noticeable also on small screens.

2019-02-28_13h10_15.mp4

[Affected versions]: 
Beta 67.0a1

[Affected platforms]:
Windows

Steps : 

1. Launch the Firefox Browser and reach https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/the-old-knight-fb720a9fc67443a6907e849a2915f7b7
2. Wait for the 3D image to load and then move it around, zoom in and out or rotate the image.


Expected Results :

The 3D image should move around and rotate smooth and without issues.
 

Actual Results : 

With WebRender on the 3D image is lagging a lot and drops frames when rotated.

This issue was tested on a Windows 10 with Nvidia GT 730.",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

Tried to obtain the values for `transferSize`, `encodedBodySize` and `decodedBodySize` values for the main document request (""navigation"" resource) on `DOMContentLoaded` and `window.load`

Demo: https://8gbhu.csb.app/


Actual results:

It seems that the `transferSize`, `encodedBodySize` and `decodedBodySize` values for the main document request (""navigation"") is not available till after an async function call after `window.onload` and incorrectly reports as 0 on events like `DOMContentLoaded` and `window.onload`

This is a bit unexpected since intuitively `transferSize` should have been available as soon as the `responseEnd` for the main document request was complete. That is also my limited understanding from the spec: https://www.w3.org/TR/resource-timing-2/#sec-process (see point 19.2).




Expected results:

I'm curious why aren't the values available sooner?

`transferSize` and associated values for the main document navigation resource should have been available right after the response for the main document, such that it can be accessed correctly on events like `DOMContentLoaded`.

As a side-note/comparison, Chromium seems to exhibit this behaviour.",Performance

Very poor SVG performance for direct SVGMatrix manipulations (analysis included),"Created attachment 8930900
Self-contained test file showing the performance problem and the workaround

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.94 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

With a moderately complex SVG file, modifying one of the top-level element's transform (e.g. in order to generate a panning/zooming effect) directly via the SVGMatrix results in very poor performance. Doing the same via setAttribute increases performance by an order of magnitude at least, depending on SVG complexity.

Attached is a test-case that performs such an animation. It displays the current framerate for the application (in my case below 10 FPS on a capable desktop machine). Clicking the ""Fix It"" button issues one single call to setAttribute and the performance immediately improves dramatically.


Actual results:

Changing the property of an SVG matrix in transform list of an SVG element results in very poor performance. 
Here is why:
When the SVG is displayed for the first time, the SVG frames are being rebuilt/cloned. This sets the nsSVGAnimatedTransformList.mHadTransformBeforeLastBaseValChange to false (because initially there was no transform set before the initial construction).
The next time the matrix is updated (not going through SetBaseVal), the falsy flag results in SVGTransformableElement::GetAttributeChangeHint to return nsChangeHint_ReconstructFrame in https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/svg/SVGTransformableElement.cpp#84, resulting in a complete frame reconstruction pass (again setting that flag to false). This cycle continues forever because with each frame the flag is false and GetAttributeChangeHint concludes that this is not just a change in the transform but requires a complete  frame reconstruction.

Once setAttribute(""transform"", ""..."") gets called the flag will finally become true for this animation frame and also for all subsequent repaints and only then the overall performance gets on par with all other current browsers.


Expected results:

The performance of changing the transform via the JavaScript API should be at least as good as via the DOM. It is orders of magnitude slower, because internally the complete SVG frames are completely reconstructed (removed, and rebuilt/cloned and restyled from scratch) with every animation frame. In our real world test-case this resulted in about 200ms of ""applying style"" for every frame where just the transform matrix got changed. This resulted in an unusable application with less than 5 FPS.

The logic in of the mHadTransformBeforeLastBaseValChange is flawed so this bug is basically a regression caused by the hack implemented for bug 1255276 : If the code only ever goes through nsSVGAnimatedTransformList::SetBaseValue once initially (during frame reconstruction/cloning) ""hadTransform"" and thus ""mHadTransformBeforeLastBaseValChange"" will always stay false, and thus will always trigger a complete and very costly frame reconstruction.

Going via setAttribute(""transform"", ""..."") makes the code use another path, setting the mHadTransformBeforeLastBaseValChange variable to true, causing all subsequent changes *not* to trigger a complete frame reconstruction, thus drastically improving performance.",Performance

Build ID: 20180625141512

Steps to reproduce:

Attached html file reproduces this problem. This problem also affects Japanese popup dictionary addons (like rikaichamp, and mine, nazeka) when used on pages of vertical Japanese text, rendering them nearly unusable because the popup dictionary performs so badly.

Interestingly, performance is fine if the body element has vertical-rl instead of the html element, but this causes the page to start at the ""bottom"" (left side) instead of the ""top"" (right side).

The problem is not the location on the page that the element is positioned.

More elaborate pages make the performance problem worse.

The profiler shows that reflowing is taking up a lot of time. It takes up far less, only a couple milliseconds, on vertical-lr pages. It takes up even more time on organic vertical-rl pages with lots of images. https://i.imgur.com/k5gXLLy.png


Actual results:

Performance of html element writing mode vertical-rl is far worse than html element writing mode vertical-lr or body element writing mode vertical-rl.

Bad performance instantiating class with constructor,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/74.0.3729.169 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I'm benchmarking various ways of class instantiation. The class consists from 6 mixins, every mixin initializes 3 properties in the constructor: 'a1', 'b1', 'c1' for Mixin1 and so forth.

Then I measure the time of creation of 10000 instances, in 3 different ways:
1) Using normal `new ClassConstructor()` call
2) Using `Object.create()` + ""external"" constructor - a regular method, called ""initialize"" which does the same thing as constructor
3) Using plain object and plain initializing functions

The benchmark is here: https://jsperf.com/object-instantiation-2


Actual results:

The normal instantiation path using class constructor is the slowest - twice (!) slower than other ""tricky"" paths.

Note, that Chrome behaves as expected.


Expected results:

Expected is that using class constructor should be the fastest, or, on par with `Object.create()`",Performance
Switch web nodes from Standard-2x to Performance-M,"Currently we use 4 dynos at `standard-2x` and I would like us to switch to `performance-m` [1].
The # of Dynos consumed will be the same, however, we will have dedicated hardware and the ability to enable autoscaling if we wish to. Using the same # of units means that we won't cost more to Mozilla and we would have burstability if needed.

I've switched stage to use `performance-m` and I've run webpagetest against the two [2]. Stage is *slightly* faster. I'm expecting performance to better under load because of a course I took back in the day where less machines with more power can throughput more than more machines with less power.

camd, sclements: Let me know if you have any objections. I will flip the switch next Monday if I don't hear back.

Reduced performance after GPU switch,"On macOS systems with two GPUs (integrated and discrete), scrolling performance in Firefox on macOS is reduced when the current GPU is different from the GPU that was in use when the Firefox window was opened.

 1. Install gfxCardStatus from https://gfx.io/
 2. Start Firefox with one window, while the integrated GPU is in use.
 3. Go to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.
 4. Switch to the discrete GPU using gfxCardStatus.
 5. Open another window of the same size and go to https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.
 6. Compare scrolling smoothness in the two windows, for example using Quartz Debug's FrameMeter overlay window.
 7. Switch back to the integrated GPU and compare scrolling smoothness again.

Expected results:

"Bad performance with css ""perspective"" set","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0

Steps to reproduce:

I noticed this with a website I've been working on, that scrolling and performance has been slow and jittery. I thought it was something I did, but upon investigation I found that everything performs fine in the release versions of firefox, and only when I loaded the page in Nightly did it start acting this way.

You can see this effect in action over here:

https://projectvinyl.net/

The site's main banner uses a css perspective of 300px and a perspective-origin set to get the parallax effects. I found that simply removing the perspective declaration (perspective-origin had no effect) that the sluggishness goes away almost completely so I suspect this is caused by some change in the how the browser handles 3d contexts.


Actual results:

The page was really sluggish. Scrolling felt slow, and the banner's parallax effect jittered as if it was done using javascript.


Expected results:

Scrolling and the parallax effect should have been smooth, as-is in Chrome, Edge, and previous (release) versions of Firefox.",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

I wrote a page, use the PerformanceObserver to get the content load and load time of the page, the sample page is attached. You can open it with Firefox 77 to reproduce it. Also I tried the developer version firefox 79.0b7, it also has the same behavior. However on the Firefox 71, it only receive one time notification. Not sure it's a bug or not.


Actual results:

Assumed I only can receive one time navigation notification when open this page, but actually I received two times, and the first time happened before document receive DOMContentLoaded event. 
Following is the page code:

            var entries = list.getEntries();

>",Performance
poor performance in firefox with webrender on raspberry pi4,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Enable gfx.webrender.all to true
2. Run 'MOZ_X11_EGL=1 firefox' in terminal


Actual results:

Firefox has visual artefacts and page load/scrolling performance is not good 


Expected results:

Firefox should have launched normally without artefacts with better or comparable performance to basic compositor",Performance
Very poor performance on 10-bit display server,"When switching X.org to run at 10-bit (Depth 30), firefox' performance drops to 1 fps everywhere - even in the main interface, with no tabs open. (Gtk-based context menus are unaffected)

Note: This is most likely a result of OpenGL-accelerated compositing not being initialized properly. One of the most common ways for OpenGL initialization to fail on a 10-bit environment is if Firefox (for whatever reason) requests a backbuffer with at least 8 bits of alpha. Since the only valid visuals on 10-bit servers have 8-bits RGB and 2-bits alpha, this would fail in such an environment. It's very possible that this bug could be solved by removing the 8-bit alpha requirement, if such a requirement exists.

Incidentally, even if OpenGL initialization fails is firefox supposed to run at 1 fps with software compositing? It used to run just fine even under software compositing, some versions (maybe 10-20) ago. What happened that caused this _massive_ regression when HW compositing is not available?

Included are some basic debugging outputs that could help track this down.

"Inside a WebWorker context, calling performance.addEventListener throws a generic NS_ERROR_FAILURE","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

Start a WebWorker with a script, and listen for errors

```
var worker = new Worker(""worker.js"");
worker.onerror = function(error) {
  console.log(error);
}
```

Worker.js attempts to listen to an event on the performance:

```
performance.addEventListener(""resourcetimingbufferfull"", function(evt) {
  console.log(""called"");
});
```



Actual results:

error {
​  bubbles: false
  cancelBubble: false
​  cancelable: true
​  colno: 0
​  composed: false
​  currentTarget: null
​  defaultPrevented: false
  error: null
​  eventPhase: 0
  explicitOriginalTarget: ...
​  filename: ""http://localhost:3000/worker.js""
​  isTrusted: true
​  lineno: 8
​  message: ""NS_ERROR_FAILURE: ""
​  originalTarget: Worker { onmessage: null, onmessageerror: null, onerror: null }
​  returnValue: true
​  srcElement: Worker { onmessage: null, onmessageerror: null, onerror: null }
​  target: Worker { onmessage: null, onmessageerror: null, onerror: null }
​  timeStamp: 149
​  type: ""error""
​}


Expected results:

No error should have been recorded, event listener should have been attached.

It does not matter if the event is defined like ""resourcetimingbufferfull"" or generic like ""foobar"", they both throw.",Performance
Severe performance degradation and high CPU usage with zoomed in SVG content,"Created attachment 9193790
Four profiles (2 in web dev mode + 2 in graphics mode), captured with clean Firefox 83 (performs as intended) and clean Firefox 84 (in which the bug is present)

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.88 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

https://u8eqg.csb.app/
Zoom in on any icon until it occupies the bulk of the container and zoom out a couple of times, then zoom in again. Now pan by holding down the left click and dragging the mouse around.


Actual results:

Firefox CPU usage skyrockets to 35%, heavy stuttering might be experienced during panning. 


Expected results:

Performance and CPU usage should only be marginally affected by the zoom level, (like in Firefox 83 and Chrome 87.0.4280.88).

Most of the time, opening the devtools alleviates the issue for some reason, as does opening the browser in safe mode. 
I've managed to reproduce the bug on multiple PCs with Firefox 84. 
Though the sandbox is using React is dev mode (which can affect performance), the same applies to the production build.
It's also worth noting that nested SVGs (<svg> inside another <svg> or <symbol> elements like in the sandbox) aggravate performance issues, no matter how simple they are, but the same can be achieved by using basic elements.",Performance

Huge performance degradation on Firefox 79 when opening web pages,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0

Steps to reproduce:

Actual results:

It takes very long to open some web pages on Firefox 79. Rendering of the page stalls and one Web Content process uses 99% of CPU core. It takes ~3 min or longer to finally render the page. Same web page on same machine with latest Chromium or Firefox 75 takes ~2s. I tried to run Firefox 79 with fresh profile without any results. The machine is AMD E-350 with 16GB of RAM, Fedora 32.

Steps to reproduce:

Hello.

First of all i'm sorry for my english, hope you'll understand the issue.

I encoutered a specific user case that make firefox cpu intensive and the rendering of all tabs (even new one) freeze. I invite you to check the attached file. This happen because i forgot to close a tag (</div>) in a loop, whitout -moz-column-width css directive browser work fine, with it just freeze.

That shouldn't happen because this code is incorrect however ie and chrome work juste fine so i'm afraid there is some kind of endless loop or memory leak or worse something that can affect security in firefox. I'm not qualified in these areas so i prefer to be carefull and hide this case from the public.


Actual results:

In my computer firefox seems entering and endless loop.


Expected results:

"Measure the performance effect of malloc poisoning on free, in mozjemalloc","tl;dr: it costs about 2.5% performance on Intel/Skylake, and more than that
in terms of number of instructions and memory traffic.

------

mozjemalloc poisons (overwrites) all memory on free, as a necessary security
measure.  This bug doesn't propose to change anything, but it serves as a
place to record measurements about the performance effects of the poisoning.
We allocate and free heap fast -- easily 100MB/sec -- and the memset calls
associated with poisoning show up frequently in profiles.

Measurements were done using the Speedometer benchmark,
http://browserbench.org/Speedometer.  The profiled build is m-c from source,
release-ish config (-O2, nondebug), on Fedora 25 x86_64.

I particularly wanted to measure this because poisoning breaks the
assumption that it is performance neutral to allocate oversize blocks and
then not use all the allocated space.  Also, poisoning has potential to
increase MESI protocol misses in situations where memory is freed by a
different thread than the one that allocated/used it.

------

Actual performance

Detecting any difference was quite tricky.  Speedometer gives the impression
of having short periods where it falls idle, which causes the CPU clock
rates to fall, confusing the measurements.  In the end I locked the clock
rate and ran on a quiet machine.  And with e10s disabled.

Because the performance of the memset calls in question is possibly strongly
dependent on CPU implementation details (cache sizes, hardware prefetch
abilities, memory/cache bandwidth), I wanted to test it on processors at
both ends of the capability spectrum.  What I had to hand is

(top end) A Xeon Skylake:
   Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1505M v5 @ 2.80GHz (4 cores, 8 threads)
   with clock rate fixed to 2.40 GHz
   
(bottom end) An Atom (Silvermont):
   Intel N 3050 (base 1.60 GHz, max 2.16 GHz) (2 cores, 2 threads)
   with clock rate fixed to 2.00 GHz

The Speedometer runs are noisy.  The results are:

   baseline, Skylake:  66.7 +/- 1.5, 65.3 +/- 1.6  --> average 66.0
   nopoison, Skylake:  67.0 +/- 1.2, 68.5 +/- 1.2  --> average 67.75

   baseline, Silvermont:  13.6 +/- 0.15
   nopoison, Silvermont:  13.8 +/- 0.24

The Skylake results are as I expected -- about a 2.5% perf loss.  The
Silvermont results surprised me.  I am not sure why it appears almost
unaffected.  I did notice that the Silvermont's clock rate wouldn't always
stay fixed, despite my best efforts.  That probably doesn't help get
reliable numbers.

------

Measurements with Callgrind

Callgrind is a great tool for getting insights into microarchitectural
effects, but it's very slow.  I decided to profile a steady-state section of
the Speedometer run -- steps 45 through 52 inclusive -- and then normalise
the results by the number of frees done.  This is on the assumption that
heap turnover is a fairly reliable indicator of the amount of useful work
done, since disabling poisoning won't change the number of
allocations/frees.

I asked Callgrind to simulate a cache hierarchy similar to that in the
Skylake.  Although that's not terribly realistic (it ignores multi-core
effects and prefetching), it does give some baseline measurement of
cache-friendlyness.  Results are:

  what               baseline       nopoison
              
  #frees            1,132,636      1,225,786

  Insns                13224M         13163M
  DataReads             3520M          3660M
  DataWrites            2773M          2256M
  D1ReadMisses         130.3M         138.9M
  D1WriteMisses         37.6M          29.0M

  Insns/free            11675          10738
  DataReads/free         3108           2985
  DataWrites/free        2448           1840
  (DR+DW)/free           5556           4825

  D1ReadMisses/free     115.0          113.3
  D1WriteMisses/free     33.2           23.7
  (D1RM+D1WM)/free      148.2          137.0

What you can take from this is:

* poisoning adds 8.7% insns per unit useful work

* and increases memory traffic by 15.1%, mostly writes (as expected)

* and increases the D1 miss rate by around 8%, unsurprisingly

I am bit suspicious that poisoning also increases the number of memory
reads.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe the frame setup/removal overheads of
calling memset?  Unlikely.  Maybe the two runs aren't exactly identical
in workload?

Given the increased instruction count, I am surprised that the Skylake only
took a 2.5% performance hit, and even more surprised -- to the extent of
disbelief -- that the Silvermont seems almost unaffected.",Performance

Slow paint performance | https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1672880 +++

I closed the original bug prematurely. It turned out to be quite reproducible and not related to other tabs.  See video of behavior here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/19d2zlCclqiNRkbn6wGb7QCyg1_328rBr/view?usp=sharing

The page is fast at one size, and once I widen it out it becomes very sluggish. If I shrink the width back down the performance is restored. I don't see a similar slowdown in other browsers.



Original report ------------>

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

I've notice sluggish performance on JS-heavy sites compared to Safari and Chrome. One site in particular is dramatically worse: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/


Actual results:

Mousing around the simulation graphic (the one with all the dots) takes the better parts of a second to show the pop-up for each dot. According to the profiler, the long pauses are in ""Paint"" calls.


Expected results:

Both Chrome and Safari show these pop-ups almost instantly.",Performance
[Apple Chip - ARM64 M1] [pinterest.com] Severe performance issues upon scrolling on pinterest with video playback,"**Affected Versions:**
84.0 - Beta RC
83.0 - Release - works with Rosetta installed

**Unaffected Version:**
Nightly (2020-12-08)

**Affected Platforms:**
ARM64 MacOS:
- miniMac: MacOS Big Sur 11.0.1, Mac mini (M1, 2020), Chip: Apple M1, display 27-inch (2560x1440), with Rosetta

**Unaffected Tested Platforms:**
MacOS 10.15 MacBook Pro 13inch, macOS Big Sur 11 (intel chip)

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Go to https://ro.pinterest.com/pin/584342120393644748/ (log in when prompted)(make sure the browser is maximized)
2. While the video is played back start scrolling up and down
3. Reload the page once if needed (performance issues are not visible enough)
4. Start scrolling again and also check the hover highlight from the address bar search options for significant delays or open new tabs

**Expected Results:**
Scrolling on Pinterest while videos are played back should be smooth

**Actual Result:**
Severe performance issues can be observed if a video is played back while scrolling on Pinterest and the suggested images are being loaded. See recording: https://streamable.com/eymtu5

**Severity suggestion: S1 - S2 - Pinterest is a common top site**
Not reproducible with Chrome using the same M1 device. Chrome nearly hits 25% CPU usage while Firefox can reach over 100% (please note macOS CPU usage shown in activity monitor is per core). Attached screenshots of core usage in Beta and Nightly (unaffected)

The significant difference in Nightly (where this is not reproducible) is that it uses WebRender while on Beta and Release we have OpenGL.

Steps to reproduce:

First, we are using Resource Timing API to confuse this browser and this functionality problem ends up being a security bug.

We are navigating the cross-origin page inside an embed tag. We can fool the browser and make it remember the typed information in the wrong place. 

This allows us to access information across origins.

I used history.back() to make sure embed tag remember the typed information.

Trying to use performance devtools crashes tab/Firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

I opened the developer tools, went to the Performance tab and pressed on ""Start Recording Performance"".

Afterwards, in the ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" tab, I repeated the process, crashing Firefox as a whole.


Actual results:

After a few seconds, the tab/Firefox crashed.


Expected results:

Started recording performance.",Performance
window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart and unloadEventEnd do not update when back/forward is clicked,"Created attachment 8962495
performancetiming-firefox.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/65.0.3325.181 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Tested in Firefox 59.0.2

1) Load a webpage

2) Click a link on that webpage that keeps you on the same origin

3) Open the console and turn on persist logs

4) In console run ""[window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart, window.performance.timing.unloadEventEnd]""

5) Click another link to the same origin

6) In console run ""[window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart, window.performance.timing.unloadEventEnd]""

7) Click back on the browser

8) In console run ""[window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart, window.performance.timing.unloadEventEnd]"" and compare the values to step #4. You will see they are the exact same.

9) Click forward on the browser

10) In console run ""[window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart, window.performance.timing.unloadEventEnd]"" and compare the values to step #6. You will see they are the exact same.


Actual results:

Values stored in window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart / unloadEventEnd are being cached from the first time the page was loaded instead of being related to the current page load


Expected results:

The values in window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart / unloadEventEnd should be updated to reflect the actual unload time of the last document (the page you clicked ""back"" or ""forward"" from).

Per the spec:
https://www.w3.org/TR/navigation-timing/#dom-performancetiming-unloadeventstart
""If the previous document and the current document have the same origin [IETF RFC 6454], this attribute must return the time immediately before the user agent starts the unload event of the previous document.""

Note: In Chrome you do get updated values for window.performance.timing.unloadEventStart / unloadEventEnd based on when you clicked back/forward, but in Firefox it uses cached values that do not update after the original page load. I haven't tested, but this issue may impact other window.performance.timing variables as well.",Performance

Reddit forums with a lot of video content are reloaded upon scrolling - poor performance,"**Affected versions**
Nightly aarch64 68.0a1 2019-05-07
Beta aarch64 v67.0b19; Build ID: 20190507205628
Release aarch64 66.0.5; Build ID: 20190507012018

**Affected platforms**
ARM64 - Windows 10.

**Steps to reproduce**
- Launch Firefox
- Go to a subreddit with a lot of video content, such as: https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/
- Scroll down a while to load the videos and suddenly scroll back up

**Expected result**
The previously loaded content should remain displayed.

**Actual Result**
Some of the videos and Site UI will need to be re-rendered: https://streamable.com/0lhn6

**Note**
 - On Release this issue is way more visible as it will cause the system crash. 
 - Nightly and Beta will not crash but mostly all the previously loaded content will be re-loaded again. 
 - The content is a bit loaded way more slowly due to video recording, but it can be reproduced. 

**Regression-Range**
Wondering if it could be due to the fix of green frames and system crashes solved in Bug 1548410",Performance
DevTools Performance waterfall graph is not selectable,"Created attachment 9210609
Screenshot-2021-03-21 13_03_48.png

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open up the Performance inspector in Developer Tools (Shift + F5)
Start recording performance on any page. 
Stop the recording.
Try to make a selection on the framerate graph by dragging over it. You can't!


Actual results:

You cannot accurately select a portion of the recording to zoom into. In fact you cannot make any selection at all unless your mouse is over the ""max / min"" FPS display, at which point the selection is made far to the right, as opposed to directly under your mouse. 


Expected results:

You should be able to drag over a portion of time in the recording with your mouse, and be able to modify the handlebars of the ""zoomed in"" portion. Clicking and dragging should select an area that corresponds with your mouse.",Performance
"When building with newer macOS SDKs, there is worse graphical performance than there is with the 10.11 SDK (both with WebRender enabled)","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.16; rv:84.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/84.0

Steps to reproduce:

I built Firefox with the macOS 11.0 SDK.

I clicked the new tab button. 


Actual results:

I noticed that it had worse graphics performance than Firefox Nightly (84) downloaded from mozilla.org.


Expected results:

The graphics performance should have stayed the same.

Notice the animation on the new tab in the video I attached. It is much choppier and the WebRender profiler also seems to show more activity. I also quickly force disabled WebRender in about:config and noticed that the new tab animation wasn't choppy anymore.

Disclaimer: I am on a Ryzen Hackintosh which has graphical issues such as worse graphics performance. I apologize if this does not happen on normal Macs.

Specs if it helps: 

* CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 1700
* Motherboard: MSI B350 PC Mate
* 16GB RAM
* GPU: Gigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT
* Software: OpenCore 0.6.2, macOS Big Sur 11.0.1 Beta (build 20B5012d, enrolled in Apple Public Beta Software Program), latest version of experimental AMD patches",Performance
Performance issue with Firefox Account Sync,"Created attachment 9097046

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Sign in with your Firefox account. Wait for sync.
2. After it is finished, go to https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/tryit.asp?filename=tryjquery_animation1 and play the animation.


Actual results:

The animation lagged. It was not smooth at all, before signing in I've tried playing it and it was smooth.


Expected results:

The animation should have played smoothly without any lag.",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

Try fast scrolling with autoscroll, Home/End, a quick touch swipe

High CPU usage, almost twice as high as with chromium 87

This performance drop affects my Android midranger with a SD730 worse than my desktop.


Actual results:

Google Maps has bad performance on Firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:106.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/106.0

Steps to reproduce:

- Open Google Maps
- Drag (pan) the map around with the mouse


Actual results:

- If dragging right away once the map loads: extremely low performance (~5FPS)
- If waiting for a few seconds for the map to ""settle"": very low performance (~10FPS)


Expected results:

Smooth panning (at least 60FPS, ideally monitor refresh rate).

-In the new window, open any website and scroll


Actual results:

Scrolling seems laggy, not smooth anymore. Additionally, the whole site seems to have poor performance compared to sites in the first window.

Interestingly, when the tab of the new window is attached to the tabbar of the first window, performance on this site is completely restored.

Steps to reproduce:

I see this performance degradation  issue daily over time.  When I restart Seamonkey  after the performance issue it takes Seamonkey anywhere from 4 to 5 minutes to actually exit cleanly.  When running Seamonkey the performance degrades over time.


Actual results:

Ever since I upgraded to Seamonkey 2.53.7.1 from the older release Seamonkey's performance has degraded.  I constantly see things like these:

----
and when monitoring performance with top I see Seamonkey running thread after thread even when on simple web pages.  I am also seeing a thread using 99.9% of the CPU processing when things get really degraded.  The other applications are not being effected - i.e. xterms, and other gui programs.  I basically have the email window open and two windows for web browsing using tabs.  Also note,  I am using Seamonkey 2.53.7.1 in the same fashion and setup that I have been using for over 20 years.   And I have folders and emails from the same period of time.  Top also indicates that no swap space is being used.

I upgraded to Slackware 14.2 from Slackware 14.0 and am using the same laptop and environment setup.  I have 24 GB of emails and data in the .mozilla/.cache directories and hundreds of folders and subfolders.  I also regularly compress folders when removing emails I do not need to keep.

I did try and build they very latest version but it requires a new compiler and will not build on Slackware 14.2.  And since one can not go back to the pre-2.53 release due to the incompatible updates I am stuck on 2.53.7.1 right now.  The latest version requires one to be Slackware 15.0

User Agent String: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:60.0) Gecko/20100101 SeaMonkey/2.53.7.1

Based upon system backups I believe I was running 2.49.5 or 2.53.4 before I did this update.  I am also using the same Window Manager - fvwm2.

Running the following script takes a noticeable amount of time in firefox, but not on chrome/chromium:

(function(){var i = 0; for (; i < 10000000; i++) {var a = +[]}}) ()

While this may not be a bug per se, rather a result of different JavaScript engine implementations, I am curious to understand why this happens, and when I asked why in the IRC, I was advised to open an issue here.

Of note that this lower performance scenario only happens if I reference external variables or prototype values. For instance, the following does not result in a performance difference:

(function(){var i = 0; for (; i < 10000000; i++) {var a = []}}) ()

Steps to reproduce:

I have 3 simplified WebAssembly tests with JavaScript polyfill that do something very similar. But the last test is 20 times slower. Expected is a factor of 2 because there is more allocated. This means there is a performance loose of factor 10. To better understand the problem here, the Java code:

```
static double test1() {
    double time = currentTimeMillis();
    char[] value = new char[7];
    for( int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++ ) {
        new String(value,0,7);
    }
    return currentTimeMillis() - time;
}

static double test2() {
    double time = currentTimeMillis();
    for( int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++ ) {
        char[] value = new char[7];
        new String(value);
    }
    return currentTimeMillis() - time;
}

static double test3() {

        char[] value = new char[7];
        new String(value,0,7);
    }
    return currentTimeMillis() - time;
}

The results of the 3 tests are:

Additional information:

I'm having performance issues on YouTube since some time (I don't remember anymore how long they exactly exist - maybe over 1 year). These performance issues even appear if no web console is opened (so this issue is different from bug #1252012 ). In a Windows 10 VM Google Chrome reacts immediately with the STR. On making a look at this I have noticed that small mouse movements on an empty area need huge amounts of cpu time (on my Linux host around 200% of 600% cpu time are used). Comparing this in the Windows 10 VM with Firefox and Google Chrome Firefox needs around 3+ times more cpu time than Google Chrome.

Steps to reproduce:

Firefox 48. Went I have Toolbox opened and not paused there is bad performance at particular situations.

I often hit situations that Firefox is very slow. I will report this situations here.

First situation since now happened when I wanted to add a bookmark from menu Bookmarks. I had to wait some time till the dialog window was open.

Second situation has happened when I wanted to use Inspector Ctrl+Shift+I. Not the inspector in Toolbox, but that inspector which is in the Developers Tools. It takes about 4 seconds to open (when I have a luck). Then in this inspector, when I found html->head->link I wanted to open stylesheet in Style editor. I clicked with secondary mouse button so context menu opened. Then I clicked on Open File in Style editor and it took few seconds to open this file. 

Another situation, when I open new www page and the CSS Editor is open and I click on Inspector, it can took about 10 seconds to open the Inspector.

Another already known problem is with Preferences:
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1288965

setTimeout and setInterval take twice as long as they should unless performance profiler is used,"Created attachment 9078791
Troubleshooting data for new firefox 69 installation exhibiting same behavior.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0

Steps to reproduce:

Used either a nested setTimeout or a setInterval function with a delay of 1000/60 (for 60fps) which measured the delay between intervals and outputted the average number of intervals per second. Tried the same thing while using the performance profiler, to diagnose delay issues.


Actual results:

Function performed at 25-32ms delay, rather than expected 16-18ms, averaging between 33fps and 41fps. Halving the delay actually resulted in the expected framerate. Using the performance profiler on the original delay resulted in the expected framerate as well, but it returned to 33fps upon closing the developer tools after using the profiler. Because the delay behaves as expected only when using the performance profiler, diagnosing was impossible. Behavior was the same regardless of the complexity of the function within, and persisted across new profiles and between Firefox 69 and 70. Using requestAnimationFrame also resulted in the expected framerate regardless of whether the profiler was used, but this is impractical for my intents (the main loop of a game), due to being tied directly to rendering performance. Behavior persisted across reboots as well, but not between different computers. Behavior ceased on its own after several hours, but has happened multiple times.


Expected results:

Delay should have been close to the specified 16.666ms/60fps, and/or should have remained the same during profiling.",Performance

Actual results:

 * The number I get on my GPU (`Mesa DRI Intel(R) HD Graphics P530 (Skylake GT2)`) is much higher if the throbber is spinning. Performance is comparable in both test-cases if WebRender is disabled.

Diff between the two test-cases is just:

Steps to reproduce:

Open two tabs. First tab: about:performance Second  tab: my Netflix DVD home page at https://dvd.netflix.com/MemberHome

Now click on ""Queue"" on the Netflix page, which takes one to https://dvd.netflix.com/Queue?qtype=DD&lnkctr=mhbque but also runs the rendering process at 25% (the equivalent of one core on my 4-core processor). This runs for about 45 seconds until the queue finishes rendering. (My Netflix DVD queue is very long: 5 at home, 473 queued, 110 saved). While Firefox is busy rendering my Netflix DVD Queue, switch to the about:performance page (see results below). After the page finishes rendering, CPU normally drops back down to 1%-3%.


Actual results:

During the 45 seconds that the rendering process is consuming the equivalent of one core, this is what I see on about:performance

First anomaly: ""Memory usage of Subprocesses"" still lists the parent, but it has dropped the child process.

Second anomaly: ""Performance of Web pages"" no longer shows the tab, ""Queue - DVD Netflix"", but it still (correctly) shows the ""about:performance"" tab.

There is no indication whatsoever that I have a web page that is essentially CPU-bound.

After the page finishes rendering:

Third anomaly: The ""Memory usage of Subprocesses"" still does not show the child (rendering) process unless I manually refresh the page (e.g., F5).

The ""Performance of Web Pages"" now correctly shows the ""Queue - DVD Netflix"" page as well as the ""about:performance"" tab.


Expected results:

During the 45 seconds that the rendering process is consuming the equivalent of one core, this is what I see on about:performance

""Memory usage of Subprocesses"" should list both the parent, and child processes all the time they exist.

""Performance of Web pages"" should continue showing both tabs, the ""about:performance"" (green) and ""Queue - DVD Netflix"" (red to indicate a resource hog).

There is no indication whatsoever that I have a web page that is essentially CPU-bound.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using the browser normally.  After a couple hours of using it from zero, the browser processes start sucking up large amounts of RAM.  I only have 8 GB of RAM in this machine, so it's a serious issue because eventually no other application will be usable.

I want to diagnose if the problem is with a specific extension or web site I use, but about:performance doesn't show any useful information in explaining this behavior.


Actual results:

According to about:performance ordered by higher amount of memory usage, Firefox is merely taking 500 MB of RAM (see attached screenshot).  The Windows Task Manager reveals rather different results, however, showing that put together all firefox.exe processes are sucking up more than 5 GB of RAM.


Expected results:

Either Firefox should use way less RAM than it's using for the small amount of browser tabs opened (and the fact none of them are doing anything), or the about:performance should reveal what is actually taking up all that memory.  Even the Youtube tab is paused and currently not playing anything.

Build ID: 20171214220032

Steps to reproduce:

59.0a1 (2017-12-14) (64-bit) - Nightly channel.

1. Accumulate tabs over days/weeks
2. Periodically restart Firefox to receive Nightly updates (now not all tabs are loaded)
3. Tab through some tabs (now some are lazily loaded in)


Actual results:

1. Some tabs don't load - they get stuck spinning
2. CPU usage is very high (single core pegged)
3. about:performance says all tabs are behaving well

Closing a tab ""stuck in loading"" completely fixes CPU usage.


Expected results:

The core issue is that Firefox was pegging a core and I had no way of knowing which of my N tabs was the problem. If about:performance (or some other tool) could help me isolate the problem, that would be very useful.

I don't know why the tabs didn't load fully, nor do I really care. I can hit reload and they work - this is pretty easy for me to handle. However, with 50-100 tabs, I rely heavily on about:performance to figure out how I can make my machine not be laggy without going through a full restart.",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

Some history: Although I primarily use Seamonkey, I've been using a 2.53 x64 build made by Frank-Rainer Grahl and this issue reproduces *WAY* faster there.

I was browsing flights on momondo.com for a period of time (10+ minutes or more) using both x64 of 58.0.1 and 59.0b7. After a while, Firefox consumes upwards of 1-2GB of RAM and becomes sluggish, unresponsive for a few seconds and generally slows down. Going to about:memory and utilizing the options from the ""Free Memory"" section to free memory helps for a little bit but the problem just comes back again after further browsing. No other site I've ever used causes this issue.


Actual results:

After browsing for a period of time (10+ minutes or more), the browser has consumed a lot of RAM and becomes sluggish and, at time, unresponsive for a few seconds.

markerPerformance.html

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:63.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/63.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open the attached file in Firefox.


Actual results:

Testing using Firefox 63 on Windows 7, I can see markers being added one at a time over the course of ~4s. (Try increasing the number of markers if you're using a beefy machine.) Testing using IE 11, Edge, and Chrome on Windows 7, the markers are added in <1s.

In the test file, replace the section:
     icon: {
      fillColor: '#ffff00',
      fillOpacity: 1,
      path: google.maps.SymbolPath.CIRCLE,
      scale: 3.5,
      strokeWeight: 1,
     },

With this:
     icon: {
      anchor: { x: 4, y: 4 },
      url: 'yellowCircle.svg',
     },

And save this as ""yellowCircle.svg"":
<svg height=""8"" width=""8"" viewBox=""0 0 8 8"" xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"">
 <circle cx=""4"" cy=""4"" r=""3.5"" fill=""#ff0"" stroke=""#000"" />
</svg>

Now Firefox adds the markers in roughly the same amount of time as the other browsers. This is just a different way of telling Firefox to draw the same circle. (From my point of view. I have no idea what's going on under the hood.)


Expected results:

Markers should be added to the map at roughly the same (fastest reasonable) speed no matter how they're specified. The time to add markers should be roughly the same as for other browsers.

Impact: makes adding 1000 markers to a map take >1s, which has important usability implications (for this type of map, on Firefox). (I work with this type of map.) This probably also generates a lot of bug reports directed to the Google Maps team, which must be frustrating for them.",Performance

With a weak Wifi card in my laptop (72 Mbit/s 2.4GHz, also close to my router) page loads take a long time, and browser is more unresponsive during these longer overall page loads.

Maybe


Expected results:

Having many active/concurrent network requests, or having slow connection speed, should not make the browser unresponsive.

(Since users with weaker (less-expensive) network hardware (wifi/ethernet/cellular), tend to have slower CPUs as well, this can be a ""double-whammy"" for performance. Slow network means requests take longer to finish, presumably end up overlapping more and competing for CPU/NIC time, and if my observations are true, increasingly tax the CPU. Slow CPU means chugging through the computational portion of scripts/network requests takes longer. It can be a vicious cycle.)

I am currently running Tb version 93.0b2 (64 bit) on my system, witch consists of Windows 10 Pro, with processor speed exceeding 4,000 MHz, and with 16 Tb of SSD RAM. All disks are SSD.

Thunderbird starts rather quickly, but the contents fill in to the different GUI panes (on the left and right hand side) very slowly (ca 40 sec).

This started occurring after upgrading to Tb version 91.1.0 (64 bit). Before that, when Thunderbird behaved normally, the complete startup time was around 4 seconds.

The same slowness applies to Tb version 93.0b2, even though it reads in the Thunderbird Beta Notes, September 9, 2021 ”fixed - IMAP startup performance improved for accounts with a multitude of folders”.

No slowness occurred with previous versions. But now, when I went back to, e.g. 91.0.2, the same slowness occurs.

This is very frustrating.

Thunderbird is slow in startup (in filling the GUI panes’ contents) also with addons disabled.

I will attach a log file, which shows in detail what Thunderbird.exe performs, when Thunderbird is launched. The log file is filtered to include only what is done by Thunderbird.exe (Tb version 93.0b2).

Could someone in your awesome team be savvy enough to analyze why it takes so long for Thunderbird to completely open (with left and right hand side GUI panes filled with data).

Actual results:

CPU utilization for that tab jumps to 100% or higher (one thread, usually), and Firefox slows down enormously (usually only for that tab), so that typing appears at one character per 15 seconds or so. Eventually the ""this tab is slowing things down"" warning appears. If you wait long enough, usually but not always, you can finally get your data entered and post the reply.


Expected results:

The reply text should be entered with relatively normal speed and fluidity, just as it is right now as I type into Bugzilla.

Steps to reproduce:

FF got updated to 89.0.2 yesterday, this morning I notice that osx is very slow and unresponsive, so I restart the system, all is fine, other applications work fine again, (to give you an idea of speed, windows office / words starts in under 2 seconds),
then I start FF again, and from this moment on everything is slow again until the next restart, this can be reproduced as many times as needed: a restart helps, but starting FF causes the problem again. 


Actual results:

I reported a similar bug a while ago, which was eventually solved, (Bug 1679168), 
when the problem occurs I open the osx monitor to see if any problems are reported in CPU time, disk access, etc. result: nothing unusual !

Very slow upload,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/98.0

Steps to reproduce:

Hello
I've got a ASUS Zenbook i5 windows 11 10.0.22000 Build 22000, all drivers up to date.
It's linked to SFR Box Fibre (1Gb/s)




Actual results:

I noticed that the upload is really very slow.

So, I tested the down and upload with the app. speedtest : download : 900mb/s upload: 350mb/s: normal I presume.

But, the same test using Firefox 98.0.2 64 bits to access to speedtest gives: download 500mb/s and upload ONLY 0.1 mb/s!!!!!!

I've got the same result with Chrome 100.0.4896.60!!!!

BUT, with Microsoft Edge 99.0.1150.55, I've got an upload at 200 mb/s !!!!!

Now, all upload with Firefox is nearly impossible: send a picture can take a few minutes!

Firefox is SLOW,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:108.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/108.0

Steps to reproduce:

I don't want to keep rehasing this, but I do not forsee myself moving away from FF anytime soon.

Sometimes I have 1000 tabs open.
The Firefox team *NEEDS* to expect that people like that use FF.



Actual results:

The solution I got before is to use some type of extension or to let the tabs expire.

I am not here to comment on that advice.

The real question is, I have multiple tab extensions installed. It is extremely likely that some of them conflict. The actual question is how do I determine exactly how and why they conflict?

Firefox gets slower over time,"### Basic information

Steps to Reproduce:
After several months of use, Firefox gets slower over time

Expected Results:
Firefox should not get slower over time.

Actual Results:

Firefox needs many seconds to load a page (i. e. 5 - 30 seconds). In the meanwhile I can open Chrome, visit the same site and it gets instantly loaded.

Thunderbird extremely slow typing or doing anything when downloading messages (and indexing?),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.89 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Typing / scrolling / anything is extremely slow - takes multiple seconds to scroll or follow up on typing. Generally the whole UX freezes.

I was trying to find a way to record and share logs or share profiling session, but I couldn't find it. Please let me know how best I can help with this bug, as it is lacking details.

I noticed that, especially now (after being offline for two weeks), while messages are being downloaded (337 out of 345), Thunderbird is EXTREMELY sluggish.

I tried disabling add-ons, I was trying to enable and disable hardware acceleration. My inbox is fairly large (46055 messages, 3.2GB size on disk), but the total profile (including subdirectories in imap) has over 15GB. Two biggest files in
C:\Users\psla\AppData\Roaming\Thunderbird\Profiles\werj21zt.default\ImapMail\mail.sepio.pl have 3.4 and 3.2GB (inbox, and one subdirectory).
The profile is located on an SSD drive.

Once the messages were downloaded, the UX stopped freezing.

While this may be jumping to conclusions, but it feels like something is blocking a UI thread while donwloading these messages (indexer?)


Actual results:

Multiple seconds to display character, to show menu, to scroll; while messages are being downloaded from IMAP.


Expected results:

Typing should be immediate and firefox shouldn't freeze.

Build ID: 2016021000

Steps to reproduce:

Open Firebug or the built-in developer toolbox; enable the network tab. Load a page in browser; does not matter the URL.

Tested with two computers running different releases of Linux (openSUSE) and Firefox: the latter being 39.0 and 44.0.2. In each case, the Firefox 'config' settings are unmodified from the distro packages.



Actual results:

For the box running Firefox 44.0.2:

The timing statistics in the Net tab of Firebug indicate the BFCache items are not 'loaded' immediately and concurrently but are staggered, with each subsequent BFCache item having a later 'request start time since the beginning' with the delta being roughly equal to the 'waiting' time of the previous item.

The end result is a much slower page load, with the delay being 100-500% the time to perform all the other tasks. Example: page loads in 6 seconds versus 1 second.

For the box running Firefox 39.0:

The BFCache items are 'loaded' immediately and concurrently, resulting in a much faster page load.


Expected results:

Based on the Mozilla documentation and other online sources, my understanding is the BFCache items should not incur time for: blocking, DNS lookup, connecting, sending, waiting and receiving (although there is a positive value shown for waiting time). Further, most of these items should be 'loaded' essentially concurrently (which corresponds to zero times for each task [excluding waiting] mentioned in previous sentence).

Build ID: 20171112125346

Steps to reproduce:

- Open the browser with 7/8 tabs. Load some of them. At least one of them being a heavy page / site like a Twitch.tv stream or TweetDeck (https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) with many columns (i've 15).
- Wait 30 minutes, 1 hour if you want to be sure.
- Switch from a light tab to an heavy one. Watch your amount of RAM taken increase, Firefox being unresponsive and your CPU being overused from several seconds on best case scenario (only 20 minutes from ff launch) to 1 minute (1+ hour from launch).


Actual results:

Already included in the previous section : high CPU / RAM usage from a few seconds to a whole minute and ""non-responsiveness"" from the browser : no new request can be processed either on the tab you're on (heavy page) or any other site (trying to open a new one will just add a new tab in the tabs bar with the loading animation). While CPU high usage is instant and durable, the increase in RAM taken is slow and mostly noticeable for the long duration issue (whole minute).
I've joined 4 images, the first one being 2 heavy CPU and RAM usages on a tab switch for a whole minute (it's not as severe after only 20 minutes of runtime thankfully). Second one shows frequent spikes after < 1h runtime. Third is similar to the second but with > 1h runtime. Fourth one shows what happen to requests probably done in a second after switching to the TweetDeck tab. These requests were never processed at all and stay as is in the Network log tab.
Since i couldn't join all the images (maybe i'll be able after submitting), here they're : https://imgur.com/a/6LrZu.

I listed Twitch.tv and TweetDeck. To a lesser extent https://warframe.market (a game specific website) also do this but it never happened yet for a whole minute on this site. I don't know if sockets are involved in the issue or not. 

In the process list i generally see 2 (on the 7) firefox.exe process taking both 25/30% CPU. Sometimes i killed the first one and it immediately loads what was processing, but it also seems to break extensions when doing so. 

I tried to disable several extensions, and also to launch Firefox in safe mode. The issue was still there. I saw some posts saying to put `accessibility.force_disabled` to `true` (or doing this via the options menu) which i did but i didn't change anything regarding my issue.

Message list scroll very slow and choppy when CardBook is used,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/60.0.3112.78 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Specific version: 55.0b2 (64-bit)
I move mouse cursor into the message list section, to the right of the folder listing and top of the preview pane using the Classic View layout with folder pane and message pane enabled. I then use the mouse to scroll up and down the list of messages.


Actual results:

The scrolling is extremely slow and choppy when it does scroll. There is a long lag and when it catches up to the scroll request, it scrolls in a choppy manner. Scrolling through a message itself once selected works just fine.


Expected results:

The scroll should work when I scroll vs a multi second delay. This has recently happened, my best guess is after the upgrade to 55.0b2 (64-bit).",Performance

Web Assembly double operations tend to be slower than JS,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/57.0.2987.133 Safari/537.36

I created a Web Assembly Benchmark that compares the runtime of different algorithms executed in pure JS with the one of the implementation compiled down to Web Assembly. The files used to create the benchmark are attached. To run the benchmark extract the files and open the index.html and click Run. 

The benchmark shows that the web assembly version of the Traveling Salesman Problem is significantly slower than the JS version. I tried to break down the benchmark into several smaller benchmarks, and it seems to me that the double operations tend to be slower in WASM than JS (see doubleCompare and doubleAdd).

The definition of doubleCompare is:
function doubleCompare() {
    var sum = 1.0;
    for (var i = 0.01; i < 10.0; i += 0.001) {
        sum += i;
    }
    return sum;
}

which compiles to the following wasm:
(func $_doubleCompare (result f64)
  (local $0 f64)
  (local $1 f64)
  (set_local $1
   (f64.const 1)
  )
  (set_local $0
   (f64.const 0.01)
  )
  (loop $label$0
   (set_local $1
    (f64.add
     (get_local $0)
     (get_local $1)
    )
   )
   (br_if $label$0
    (f64.lt
     (tee_local $0
      (f64.add
       (get_local $0)
       (f64.const 0.001)
      )
     )
     (f64.const 10)
    )
   )
  )
  (get_local $1)
 )


and for doubleAdd
function doubleAdd() {
    ""use speedyjs"";
    var sum = 0.0;
    for (var i = 0; i < 100001; ++i) {
        sum += 0.00001;
    }
    return sum | 0;
}

with the following wasm representation
(func $_doubleAdd (result i32)
  (local $0 i32)
  (local $1 f64)
  (set_local $1
   (f64.const 0)
  )
  (set_local $0
   (i32.const 100001)
  )
  (loop $label$0
   (set_local $1
    (f64.add
     (get_local $1)
     (f64.const 1e-05)
    )
   )
   (br_if $label$0
    (tee_local $0
     (i32.add
      (get_local $0)
      (i32.const -1)
     )
    )
   )
  )
  (i32.trunc_s/f64
   (get_local $1)
  )

The benchmark results show that the WASM implementations tend to be slower than the js version.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Run Firefox.


Actual results:

As of late (this has actually been going on for a while, but it only seems to get worse with every version), Firefox is getting ridiculously slow and CPU consuming, to the point where it keeps freezing every couple of seconds, crashing, and usually also taking huge amounts of RAM with it.

The number of tabs or their content does not seem to matter at all.

When running a fresh copy of Firefox (using the Refresh option), this still happens.

However, when running in Safe Mode, it doesn't happen, and Firefox works as smooth as it used to.

At the same time, if I don't run in safe mode, and instead manually go and disable all extensions and plugins, which is presumably what safe mode does, this issue still happens.

Beside running in safe mode, I couldn't find any solution or setting that helped mitigate the issue.

Build ID: 20180327091359

Steps to reproduce:

For folders without offline storage (no mbox or maildir files containing a local copy of the message) when messages are accessed having attachments or other ""mime"" content, the main message body is always fetched from the network even if it was previously accessed and stored to cache.

Also, when a message with attachments and/or mime content is displayed with ""show source"" or it is ""saved to file"",  the main body and mime parts are not completely stored to cache. So when main body or attachments are accessed again, they are obtained from the network again and then stored to cache.




Actual results:

On a fast network this unnecessary network activity may not be noticed.  However, on a metered network, this redundant network activity may add some cost.  Also, it just kind of bothers me to see unneeded network activity.


Expected results:

When re-accessing a message, obtain as much as possible from cache instead of going to the network to obtain the content. Also, when saving or displaying the source for a message, ensure the full message is saved to cache and that it is fully accessible.

Note: Currently attachments are, in general, properly saved to cache and later accessed from cache.  However, the main message body is not, which is addressed here.

Steps to reproduce:

I work on the mono runtime team. We have an interpreter (for MSIL/C#) written in C that is compiled using emscripten to wasm. The interpreter is basically a while (1) followed by a huge switch. Performance seems subpar on spider monkey (and JavaScriptCore), compared to V8. After further investigation, it would seem br_table doesn't scale up.

Consider this C file https://gist.github.com/BrzVlad/1b5a6bdb20205db1c970edae709d337e. Compile it to wasm using an emsdk (emsdk/upstream/emscripten/emcc -O2 huge-interp.c). Run it once as is and once with SWITCH_CASE defined to nothing.


Actual results:

While on v8 you can see that the performance is more or less the same, on sm the test case becomes 10x slower, which shouldn't happen. I suspect this greatly impacts our performance.


Expected results:

I hope the performance on this test case can be improved soon. I would hope to be able to compare the performance of the wasm runtimes with our interpreter without this small issue distorting the results.

In addition to this, it would be great if you could give me some tips, so I can compare the generated code by the wasm runtimes for hot code paths. I'm particularly interested in a flag/env var to force the best tier (is it --ion-eager ?).  Also how can I check the generated native code for a method, or for all of them (have it dumped to console).",Performance

 - Zooming in on a chunk towards the end (and hovering on & above the colorful blue ""reflow"" bar), we can see that the reflows are 10-11ms long, and refresh driver ticks are 20-23ms long.
 - Based on trying this a few times with varying amounts of content, the reflow time seems to increase with the amount of text that's been entered so far. (hence, STR step 3, to make the costs noticable here.)


EXPECTED RESULTS:
We'd like refresh driver ticks to be under 16ms and reflows to not occupy a significant portion of that, for small changes like character entry into this compose-message field.


(Note: I'm spinning this off of bug 1418145 since I don't know precisely what the STR were there, and the results aren't quite as bad as the ones reported over there.)",Performance
Password manager incredibly slow on Windows 7 with USB drive,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0

Steps to reproduce:

Install Firefox latest release on USB SSD
Put profile on the same drive.
run Firefox on Windows 7 64 bit pro
Go to Options>Security>Saved Logins...push button



Actual results:

My list of saved logins takes as long as 2 minutes to load, during which time the CPU utilization is nearly 0, nearly 0 i/o and network, memory not very busy.
Browser goes into (Not Responding) mode
The pop-up doesn't even start to paint for over a minute
If I access the password manager via the url (chrome://passwordmgr/content/passwordManager.xul), the initial frame doesn't even paint for at least 30 seconds, and it stays blank until all of a sudden the full set shows up.
Occasionally, I'll get a ""script not responding"" popup, indicating line 236 (?) from the password manager script.


Expected results:

On my Win10 64 bit pro box, the exact same sequence completes fully in less than 2 seconds.  The new box isn't *that* much faster...but the CPU utilization during those 2 seconds is pretty decent.  The Win7 box just seems to be waiting for something to occur before it gets to work on the password manager list.
I messed around with Safe mode and using the most bare-bones profile...nothing seems to make much of a difference.

Usability: The slow extension infobar disappears too quickly,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:62.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/62.0

Steps to reproduce:

I haven't found a reliable way to get the ""A script in the extension '...' is causing Firefox to slow down."" banner to appear.

The LastPass plugin tends to slow down some pages (this is a LastPass issue, not a Firefox one), especially those with large forms. When this happens on an already overloaded system, the banner usually appears.

The ""Local Links"" extension seems to exhibit similar behavior (warning: untested, needs a local agent, proceed with caution) : https://github.com/feinstaub/webextension_local_filesystem_links/issues/109


Actual results:

Sometime the warning appears for as little as 1 second, making it impossible to click on any of the buttons.


Expected results:

Steps : 
1. Launch the Firefox browser and reach https://onetoldstori.es/yelloworld
2. Click the Middle of the screen and then drag to the right as much as possible in order for the animation to start moving as fast as possible.


Expected Results :

Steps to reproduce:

I created a simple script (attached) that traverses the DOM of a webpage and looks up the computed styles of the elements.

I ran this script in three ways:

1) Firefox bookmarklet
2) Chrome extension
3) Firefox extension

The Firefox extension loads and executes the script when the user click the browser button.

Firefox background page:

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {
     browser.tabs.executeScript(null, {file:""tryrun.js""}); 
});

I measured the time to execute the traversal, which does not include time to load the extension/bookmarklet, etc.


Actual results:

The Firefox extension is really slow compared to the other methods. I ran it on the following basic webpage: http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/3256/moroccan-lamb-with-apricots-almonds-and-mint

The sys numbers are still a bit high for my liking. But context switches are *way* down, dare I say reasonable.

The TC team stood up a docker worker and gave me SSH access to investigate.

I initially thought OS and kernel differences might be to blame. My instance was running Ubuntu 16.04 (Linux 4.4). TC was running Ubuntu 14.04 (Linux 3.13) and had a number of outdated system packages. Upgrading system packages (including the kernel) and rebooting appeared to make things a bit faster. Although I would have to measure again to confirm.

I built Firefox from source outside of Docker and both my instance and TC instance had remarkably similar times:

  5:04 wall vs   5:03 wall
143:28 user vs 143:08 user
  9:18 sys  vs   9:29 sys

Inside Docker was a different story.

Building from a host-mounted ext4 volume was slightly slower:

  5:42 wall
136:49 user
 13:54 sys

But building from a Docker aufs volume was much slower:

  8:38 wall
132:19 user
 75:03 sys

dstat output during parts of the build was horrendous:

95% CPU time in the kernel!!!

So it appears aufs under high load is a steaming pile. This shouldn't come as a surprise - aufs is an abandoned project and overlayfs is the equivalent technology that's part of the Linux kernel.

So where does this leave us? Well, TaskCluster is using aufs heavily in production. My understanding is that unless a cache is declared (caches use volumes mounted from the host and are backed by ext4), your I/O inside a TC task will be using aufs. And if aufs has performance problems, well, TC tasks will be slow.

The good news is a *lot* of Firefox automation uses caches (read: no aufs), so the negative impact of aufs is mitigated a bit. However, caches are stripped on most Try tasks because of concerns over cache poisoning. So e.g. a TC Firefox build will use ext4 on mozilla-central but aufs on Try. That means Try tasks will be slower than non-Try tasks. In theory, this applies to non-build tasks as well.

A potential silver lining is that the aufs performance degradation might only be for large CPU counts driving high concurrent I/O loads. In bug 1290282, c3.4xlarge instances were faster than c3.2xlarge instances (not linear as expected but still pretty good) whereas c3.8xlarge hardly had any advantage over c3.4xlarge despite double the cores. I'll have to run some tests on less beefy instances to see if aufs overhead is measurable on e.g. 1, 2, and 4 core instances, which make up most of the instances in TC. If it is, then this performance problem could result in thousands of hours of wasted machine time every day.

Per discussion in #taskcluster, jonasfj and garndt have ideas for addressing this at the worker level. I'll let them chime in.",Performance

Here's a profile I recorded with the STR: https://perfht.ml/2B625WY


The culprit is this code in codeMirror:

Here's another profile when the output contains only 3 one-line logs: https://perfht.ml/2B6cPEN . We can see that there's nothing too costly happening.

Also, if you : 
- clear the console
- evaluate `""\n"".repeat(10000)` (this will create a longString)
- go to the top
- click on the arrow before the string
- scroll to the very bottom
- in the input, hit Shift + Enter to have multiple lines
- and hit ArrowUp to navigate the cursor one line up

you'll be able to see that this is not as costly as with the 9000 lines tall evaluation (https://perfht.ml/2B63Fbl).",Performance

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:64.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/64.0

Steps to reproduce:

I was benchmarking the speed of comparing constructors vs using typeof on perf.zone (see links below for final benchamark code). I noticed Firefox was performing much slower than Chrome. Investigating, I realized that the numbers I used were all integers, so I wondered if *maybe* internal optimizations to use 32-bit integers somehow made this much slower.

New-tab page has some kinda-slow synchronous flexbox/grid layout,"STR:
 0. Install profiler from https://profiler.firefox.com/
 1. Visit about:blank.
 2. Ctrl+Shift+1 to start profiling.
 3. Ctrl+T to open a new tab.
 4. After a few seconds, Ctrl+Shift+2 to stop profiling.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Profile shows a red bar for a period of jank, which includes some flexbox layout.  In particular, there are some script-triggered sync reflows from an IntersectionObserver callback which checks `.clientWidth`, which I suspect are associated with image lazy-loading.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
I suspect the series of short script/IntersectionObserver-triggered reflows should probably be cheap or free, because layout is probably not changing much.  I'm not sure whether the tiles are styled such that we can theoretically infer that the flex containers involved don't need to reflow, or if there's styling that we would need to add (along with optimizations) to reliably get that result -- but one way or another, we should try to be sure that no serious reflow work needs to happen after the initial layout.

Also/alternatively, perhaps the about:newtab code shouldn't be reading clientWidth in the IntersectionObserver callback, since that forces any of the callback's earlier restyling to be immediately flushed. We're probably not coalescing these multiple IntersectionObserver-callback-invocations' restyling at all right now, due to the fact that they're doing this flush.

Here's a profile I captured of the STR, using current Nightly: https://perfht.ml/2SWyogu (filtered for nsFlexContainerFrame)

Most of the time this issue only affects me after a reboot. Restarting Firefox always works fine. Logout and subsequent login can lead to a long wait. But not always.

Loading new scripts is slow when the dev tools debugger pane is open,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Build ID: 20170822142709

Steps to reproduce:

Open the debugger pane in the developer tools, and load a page that asynchronously loads many scripts. This is common behavior when developing with requirejs and running unoptimized, since in this case, requirejs dynamically creates new script tags to load dependencies.

I have created a benchmark to demonstrate this issue:

https://github.com/jwmerrill/async-script-load-benchmark


Actual results:

Having the debugger pane open makes asynchronously loading additional scripts much slower. Note that the problem also appears if you have the dev tools open and you have ever visited the debugger panel. It does not need to be the currently active panel, you just need to have activated it at some point during your session.

In Firefox 57 (currently nightly), loading 1000 files in this tool takes 1 second with dev tools closed, and 11 seconds with dev tools open to the debugger pane. Loading 2000 files takes 2 seconds with dev tools closed, and 30 seconds with the debugger open. Loading 5000 files takes 6 seconds with dev tools closed, and 2.5 minutes with the debugger open. In all cases, the branching factor was set to 2.

The problem seems to be worse in Firefox 55 and Firefox 56.


Expected results:

Loading scripts with the debugger open should be fast, and the amount of time that it takes to load each new script should not increase with the number of scripts you have already loaded (the benchmark shows superlinear scaling with the number of scripts you attempt to load).

Chrome takes a similar amount of time to run the benchmark with dev tools closed, but opening dev tools only slows things down by 20-40% instead of a factor of 10 or more.",Performance

Loading breakpoints is slow on pages with many scripts,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0

Steps to reproduce:

The app I'm working on has about 250 scripts, which are not bundled at all in debug mode.  Loading pages with any breakpoints set takes several seconds longer.  I understand that I have a lot of scripts, but this still seems like too much time.


Actual results:

This is a fairly typical profile, with 5 breakpoints set: https://perf-html.io/public/fae3b88abc1c4e731cca8cd8180f8aaa39e92688/flame-graph/?globalTrackOrder=6-0-2-3-4-5-1-7-8-9-10-11&hiddenGlobalTracks=1-2-3-5-6-7-9-10&localTrackOrderByPid=16804-0~3108-0~&thread=11&transforms=ff-180~mf-170~mcn-combined-Bk_j_k_oz_s~mcn-combined-Bk_j_k_oN0&v=3
It shows several seconds spent in Debugger::findScripts(), and GetScriptLineExtent() in particular.

Looking up the stack, it appears that _addSource() is called for every script, which calls _setBreakpointAtGeneratedLocation() for every breakpoint, which calls Debugger::findScripts(), which calls ScriptQuery::consider() for every script.  This would mean that loading breakpoints for the entire page takes quadratic time with respect to the number of scripts.


Expected results:

I think that the slowdown could be avoided by filtering breakpoints down to those that match the script passed to _addSource().  This wouldn't stop multiple breakpoints in the same file all calling findScripts() for that file, but it would stop them calling it for every single script.

This is more tentative, but I think the commonFilter check in consider() would benefit from being moved ahead of the line and possibly realm checks, as well.  The URL and source comparisons seem like they should be pretty cheap and would have a very low false-positive rate.",Performance
No Ion on ARM64 makes asm.js very slow,"This morning I ran some benchmarks in order to assess whether the JS baseline compiler performs about the same on ARM64 as on X64, see writeup on methodology and results here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nyUDioN48DUw5S7YdIMTq1iQC5oiyGJl8PBYtiuSCmc.

Overall things look just fine, with most benchmarks performing on ARM64 about as well as expected, given the observed difference in the performance of the two test systems.

However, the zlib benchmark is a very strong outlier, taking over an order of magnitude longer to finish on ARM64 than it is expected to.  If we assume that the x64 code is correct, this suggests that there is probably a bug in the JS baseline compiler (or interpreter) for arm64; at least this needs investigation.  (Whether performance bug or functional bug is impossible to say right now, I don't know how well Octane checks its output.)",Performance

Proxy failover (from .pac) results in slow web browsing experience,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0

Steps to reproduce:

We use a ""proxy.pac"" file which sets a specific proxy ""localhost:3128"" (which is a port forwarded by putty) for specific webpages. 

This proxy is only needed, if user is outside of LAN and only in that case putty is running and the ""localhost:3128"" port is available.

Up to Firefox version 64.0.2 this worked fine: In LAN Proxy ""localhost:3128"" failed, so after first try Firefox switched to DIRECT and worked with very good speed.

But starting with 65.0.0 in that case a delay is added with every network connection. Browsing is very slow now, when the first proxy is not available.

Up to now we did not roll out versions higher than 64.0.2 because of this. But now we have to because of the AddOn issue fixed in version 66.0.4... :(

The proxy.pac looks like this:

function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
{
  var proxy = ""PROXY localhost:3128; DIRECT"";
  var no_proxy = ""DIRECT"";

  if (dnsDomainIs(host, "".xycorp"")
      || shExpMatch(host,""confluence.xycorp.com"")
      || shExpMatch(host,""jira.xycorp.com"")
  {
    return proxy;
  }

  return no_proxy;
}


Actual results:

A delay of ~1..2 seconds is added on every connection. Web browsing feels very slow, if the first proxy configured is not available.


Expected results:

If the first proxy is not available Firefox should use the second proxy (in out case DIRECT) and work fast as usual.",Performance

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0

Steps to reproduce:

I tried uploading a file and noticed that Firefox is slow with uploading.

Uploading any file in Firefox is so slow (max is 20mbps or 2.4MB/s)



Actual results:

I tried uploading on Google Drive or any speedtest like https://speedof.me, max speed with upload I get is always ~18mbps)

Downloading with Firefox is fine, but not uploading.

The problem exists for me (and my friend) on any browser based on Gecko. I tried Pale Moon and the same problem.

Please read the explanation on ""What should have happened? (expected results)"" below.


Expected results:

I should be getting my max speed which is 350mbps for upload.

I tried uploading on all other browsers (Edge, Chrome and even Internet Explorer) and I got 45MB/s with upload except for Firefox, I get 2.5MB/s

Now before you tell me to clear cache or reset Firefox or reset or change router or anything, I saved you time by doing a lot of things including:

1. A fresh Windows install (both Windows 7 and 10)
2. Older versions of Firefox
3. Tried on ubuntu, I got the same slow speed (even though it was 35mbps on ubuntu but still far from my max which is 350mbps or 44MB/s)
4. Tried more than one PC
5. And lastly I tried on my friend's home with a different ISP. (this shocked me because it's the same problem)

None of the above helped. What I think is that my country (Jordan) has a problem with Firefox ports or something, it's really weird.

One of my friends also has the same problem and he's in another country.
(and to be honest I asked around 10 friends and only one of them has this problem, so it's not really easy to reproduce)
Few people on the internet has had this problem but no helpful answers to it.
e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/8fjrcj/youtube_uploads_capped_at_25mbs_in_firefox_not/

I successfully got my upload speed to 8MB/s (still not what I should be getting) on Firefox by forcing an old TLS version in about:config and by setting the following to 1:

security.tls.version.max
and
security.tls.version.fallback-limit

My friend is experienced and he told me the following after I did that with TLS and told him:

""The only idea I have is that Firefox's encryption implementation is absolutely bad or doesn't use hardware acceleration.

Would explain why downgrading TLS increased your speed, and why this problem only occurs with very high upload speeds"".

Hopefully you can find the cause of this problem :)
I really don't want to be forced to move to another browser.

I attached a file uploading on Chrome vs Firefox, you can notice on the internet speed meter at the bottom of both pictures how Firefox is extremely slow compared to Chrome.

Steps to reproduce:

We found a performance issue for resources coming from specific domains when the service worker is present and has a fetch handler (even if it's just an empty function). To reproduce this you can open this page (make sure to disable Cache in Network tab and refresh once SW is installed):

https://ultimate-fairy-77.app.baqend.com

By default, the SW is enabled. To disable the Worker, add `?sw=false` to URL and refresh twice to see effects. They are roughly the same speed when SW is not present. 

We found several scripts that have this issue, all of them seem to be detected as a tracker in the Network tab, but disabling Tracking Protection did not help.

We also tested this on Nightly and Beta with no success.


Actual results:

The affected request often takes over 1 second with SW, and under 100ms without.

Actual results:

When I keep pressing a key inside an editable cell or keep pressing backspace to delete the contents, Firefox updates the cell in a slow speed (seems like slow typing). If I remove ""border-collapse: collapse;"" from ""#table1"" or remove ""border: 1px solid black;"" from ""#table1 td"", the speed is back to normal. Chrome does not experience this slow speed. I have tested many Firefox portable versions. The last one that works correctly is 48.0.2. Delayed typing is happening in all versions after 48.0.2.

Text Inputting with IME is too slow & delay on macOS,"## Environment

* https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/7007206a3cd46da7c478e5a9992b608b743a1ff9

* Using macOS' default Japanese IME.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open https://twitter.com/.
2. Focus to their text input area.
3. Input some texts with enabling Japanese IME.


## Actual Result

* Showing a text which I'm inputting is too slow (delay).
* This problem happens with plain <textarea/>. But it's striking with a rich text editor on Web Application, such Google Docs, Gmail's mail editor, https://hangouts.google.com/, or twitter's text form.



## Expected Result


* Not Slow.



## Remarks

* I don't know when this problem has begun... But I seem this problem is striking these days.
* A text input with Japanese IME is actually slow on recently macOS. But it's especially slow on Firefox.
    * I feel this problem is a little relaxed if I disable ""ライブ変換 (I don't know this feature's English name)"". But it does not improve much.

will-change makes painting several orders of magnitude slower,"Created attachment 9050810
Reproduction example

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:67.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/67.0

Steps to reproduce:

Material Design Components for Web (https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) is very fond of ""will-change: transform,opacity;"", and has it set on simple things like their MDCButton (supposedly to warn the browser of the ""ripple"" effect that will come).

I observed that a page with a relatively low amount of buttons (thus will-change: opacity elements), in the ballpark of 60 buttons, would cause painting to come grinding to a halt.

With the console closed, paint time appears to be in the order of several seconds. However, a peculiar observation is that opening the console makes the problem much milder, which is of course unfortunate for performance tracing. For this particular site, a performance trace shows up to 900ms to paint.

Without will-change, painting only takes a few milliseconds.

While my minimal reproduction is attached. It is not quite as intense as the real page, but it shows the difference very clearly.

1. Create a table with 10 cols by 50 rows
2. Observe time spent painting on load
3. Set will-change: opacity
4. Observe time spent painting on load


Actual results:

The first test without will-change spends about 40ms in total painting on my small laptop, where the second test with will-change spends around 350ms painting.


Expected results:

Both tests should have spent a similar time painting.",Performance

On some devices the performance of Fenix is running x10 slower javascript calculations.

It is probably related to aarch64 build optimizations.
When building an app, using arm aar, there is no performance issue on the same device, and it is slow as hell when built with aarch arr.

UnMHT causes slow url transition on e10s,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160309040627

Steps to reproduce:

1. Turn on e10s
2. Open arround 10 tabs
3. Switch tabs


Actual results:

The URL bar inidicating current page URL sometimes takes a while to load, which is still showing last switched tab URL.
Sometime the loading just failed until the next link has been click, which makes the URL change, then the URL will be refreshed.


Expected results:

Immediate showing the current page URL",Performance
SVG path changes on scroll are slow,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I am having an issue with my open source library Shepherd. We use an SVG and change the coordinates for the `path` inside it on scroll, to create a hole in the svg to highlight elements. You can see a demo here https://shepherdjs.dev/demo/


Actual results:

In Chrome, the hole does not jump around if you scroll up and down quickly and repeatedly, but in Firefox it jumps around a lot.


Expected results:

I would expect Firefox to have a similar performance to Chrome and Safari and not jump as much on the path recalculation. I am not sure if this is a requestAnimationFrame problem, an SVG rendering problem, or just a performance difference in reflows between the browsers.",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

Using 2 devices signed it into same account.
1) put one device to sleep
2)  use second device to send tab to the first device
3) wake up the first device and measure how long it takes to receive the send tab


Actual results:

It can be less, but probably also more.


Expected results:

This bug a bit random but if you use this feature often, you notice it a lot.
I guess the problem may be missing internet access few seconds after PC wakes up from sleep. However the common approach in such cases is simply retry with longer and longer delay (Google chat used to do that if you went offline).",Performance

Steps to reproduce:

Ubuntu 21.10 installs the Snap version of Firefox per default (as requested by Mozilla according to https://news.itsfoss.com/ubuntu-firefox-snap-default/ ). This causes a Firefox cold start to be really slow, 12 seconds on my computer. You can still install the APT version of Firefox on Ubuntu 21.10, where the cold start only takes 2 seconds.


Actual results:

The Snap version of Firefox is slow, takes 12 seconds.

The Snap version of Firefox should start much faster, comparable to the APT version. How can we improve the Snap platform so that applications are not 6 times slower than their native APT counter parts?",Performance

Bug suggestions are slow to load - loading indication goes away before it has loaded,"In the last month or so, loading the failure summary seems to have got slower. As a result, it can frequently finish loading multiple seconds after the loading indication has gone away.

Checking the network, it is actually the bug_suggestions API that is slow and can take ~10s.

STR

1. Load the treeherder UI and find some sections with failures.
2. Select a failure and wait for it to load.
2. Select a different failure with the mouse.

Actual Results

* As you click, there is a loading indication.
* The loading indication goes away after a short time (1-2s)
* The failure summary section changes after more than 2-10s after the loading indication has been removed.

This can lead you into thinking the summary is the same as the previous build, when it isn't.

Expected Results

The loading indication should not go away until the failure summary is completely loaded. This would allow you to be certain that the loaded log is the correct one.

A second issue might be why bug suggestions are taking up to 10s to load.",Performance

The Internet Download Manager add-on can seriously slow down Firefox with e10s,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; WOW64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Build ID: 20161129173726

Steps to reproduce:

Installs with e10s enabled are horrifically slow. I have multiple machines running identical, local hosted web apps on identically hardware spec'd machines. In instances where FF chooses to enable e10s, CPU usage is 2x worse and memory is 10x worse. This is not ideal. To add insult to injury, the system mis-reports the cause of the problem.


Actual results:

Poor performing instances have e10s enabled. CPU is roughly 2x worse and RAM usage is roughly 10x worse than instances of the same FF version where e10s is not enabled. All badly performing instances show plugin-container.exe as the problem and disabling plugins does nothing to resolve the situation. Setting all plugins to ""Never Activate"" does nothing to plugin-container.exe resource usage.


Expected results:

Setting plugins to ""Never Activate"" should always solve problems with Firefox's ""plugin-container.exe"" causing resource problems. Instead disabling e10s completely reliably solves these performance problems.

Mach makes link failures annoyingly slow with xterm on Mac,"This has been bothering me for a while; I finally took the time to make some measurements.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE:

1)  Create a clean Firefox build.
2)  Open dom/base/Element.cpp in an editor.
3)  Delete of #if 0 out the function with this declaration:

      bool
      Element::GetAttr(int32_t aNameSpaceID, nsIAtom* aName,
                       nsAString& aResult) const
4)  time mach build dom/base

ACTUAL RESULTS: The link failure causes us to show the contents of $objdir/toolkit/library/${RANDOM}.list, which is a long list of .o files.  It takes 35+ seconds to show this list over here.  During this time, we're not even CPU-bound; I'm seeing 5s user time, 1s system time, 18% CPU utilization.

EXPECTED RESULTS: It shouldn't take nearly this long to show the list.  The list has about 1900 entries.  We're taking about 35 seconds, of which about 5 seconds is real work (more on this below).  So we're showing 63 list entries per second, or one entry per 16ms.  There's no way we should need 16ms of processing per entry.  This is suspicious; see below.

Some additional information on the performance:

1)  If I pass --log-no-times to mach, that does not change timing.
2)  If I pipe the entire operation through cat, while still logging times,
    the entire thing takes about 4s (according to mach's own timing).
3)  If I change _colorize in python/mach/mach/logging.py to just return s
    immediately, times are unchanged.
4)  If I change the format() function in python/mach/mach/logging.py to just
    set ""t"" to format_seconds(self._time(record)) instead of doing the
    terminal.blue() thing, then times are unchanged (though the coloring
    goes away, as expected).
5)  If I use Terminal.app instead of xterm, time is about 4s with the coloring
    either on or off.
6)  If I completely cover up my xterm window right after I start the mach build,
    things take 4s (!).

So at a guess, in the normal mode we're doing some sort of terminal flush at every line that causes the terminal to wait for vsync or something.  That would be consistent with the 16ms-per-line thing, as well as the ""CPU usage is actually low"" thing.

"Slow opening large gmail IMAP folder, even when there are no new messages in that folder.  (Slow Fetch?)","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:57.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/57.0
Build ID: 20171227151206

Steps to reproduce:

Thunderbird is very slow when updating a very large (>100k emails) folder in an IMAP (Gmail) account. When I start Thunderbird and select an email in the large folder, the status line says ""Sending login information"", ""Opening folder ..."" or ""Loading message..."" or something like that, the progress bar spinning, and hangs in this state for dozens of seconds or a minute before showing the email contents. I can navigate the other folders and even open emails there, but the large folder stays ""locked"" this way for quite a while. When it unlocks, I can click on messages in the folder and they are shown almost immediately until I click ""Get Messages"" or Thunderbird checks for new email on timer. When synchronization starts, the folder gets ""locked"" again, and I can only view messages that I clicked *before* the sync started - any messages I didn't open in this folder since Thunderbird started are not displayed, any new (unread) messages in the mailbox are not shown either in the message list until the folder gets ""unlocked"".

So the steps to reproduce would be roughly this:

1. Have an IMAP account with multiple folders, one of which is very large (> 100k messages). In my case, this is a mailing list folder. In my case, the account is configured as Disconnected IMAP (i.e. the messages are stored locally and synchronized with the remote server).
2. Initiate synchronization of the local cache with the remote IMAP server. This can be done by either just starting Thunderbird (it starts sync on startup) or pressing ""Get Messages"" or waiting until it performs the periodic synchronization.
3. Try navigating the large folder and clicking on different messages. You will notice that contents of many or all messages are not displayed in the lower section of the interface.

While in this ""locked"" state, Thunderbird doesn't seem to be doing anything CPU-bound (the CPU is loaded by 2-5% by Thunderbird), but it looks like it is downloading something at ~150 kbit/s rate.

What I tried and it didn't help:

- Compacting the folder
- Repairing the folder
- Deleting and re-creating the account, which involved re-downloading all messages
- In the account settings, configuring ""Synchronize the most recent"" to 3 months or 30 days (at this point I already downloaded all messages from server)

I do need all messages locally so that I'm able to search for older messages from time to time, so not downloading and keeping messages in the local cache is not a solution for me.

Kubuntu 17.10 x86_64, Thunderbird 52.5.0, 64-bit.



Actual results:

The synchronization with the remote IMAP server apparently takes a lot of time (tens of seconds) and messages in the local folder are inaccessible for all this time.


Expected results:

I don't think that checking for new messages on the remote server should take that long. Even if it does, I would expect that the locally stored messages that were downloaded previously to be fully accessible while sync is in progress.",Performance

Browser extremely slow with color management always enabled,"Since the 2018-06-16 Nightly, Firefox has felt extremely sluggish for me. Every input takes half a second to register, and with Webrender enabled painting feels like it's happening at ~3fps. I tracked this down to a small change from bug 1464039: https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/rev/dfcc5301e872

My monitor is calibrated and profiled using an X-Rite ColorMunki Display and the open source ArgyllCMS toolkit. I'm using a LUT profile which requires gfx.color_management.enablev4 == true, and I'm applying it to every image using gfx.color_management.mode == 1.

If I set gfx.color_management.mode to 2 (the default), the performance issue goes away. So it seems something in my profile is triggering this path, and it makes everything extremely slow. I'm uploading my profile so you can have a look.

I'm on Windows 10 x64 revision 1803 (the April 2018 update), using the 64-bit Nightly, and my graphics card is a GeForce GTX 1080 with the latest drivers. I see the same problem on my laptop with a GeForce GTX 1060 and a different profile (but generated in the same way).

I'm not sure what the policy is on bugs that (should) block security bugs so I've marked this as security sensitive for now.

Steps to reproduce:
Starting from a fresh profile,
1) Set gfx.color_management.display_profile to the location of the profile (or set the profile as your monitor profile system-wide)
2) Set gfx.color_management.enablev4 to true
3) Set gfx.color_management.mode to 1
4) Set gfx.webrender.all to true (optional)

Slow paint performance | https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/,"+++ This bug was initially created as a clone of Bug #1672880 +++

I closed the original bug prematurely. It turned out to be quite reproducible and not related to other tabs.  See video of behavior here:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/19d2zlCclqiNRkbn6wGb7QCyg1_328rBr/view?usp=sharing

The page is fast at one size, and once I widen it out it becomes very sluggish. If I shrink the width back down the performance is restored. I don't see a similar slowdown in other browsers.



Original report ------------>

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

I've notice sluggish performance on JS-heavy sites compared to Safari and Chrome. One site in particular is dramatically worse: https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/


Actual results:

Mousing around the simulation graphic (the one with all the dots) takes the better parts of a second to show the pop-up for each dot. According to the profiler, the long pauses are in ""Paint"" calls.


Expected results:

Both Chrome and Safari show these pop-ups almost instantly.",Performance
Reflow time terribly slow when nest grid depth of DOM tree > 8,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0

Steps to reproduce:

Just did some tests on Firefox 83 and DOM reflow time grows exponentially with the depth of DOM tree. With grid elements of depth 10 single reflow takes seconds on my Ryzen laptop while on chromium is not noticeable at all.


Actual results:

Couple of seconds to render single added DOM element at the bottom of tree.


Expected results:

Adding elements at the bottom should be not noticeable as it is in Chromium",Performance
The Javascript slide is too slow on gsfresh.com (3d transforms) (software webrender),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.16; rv:86.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/86.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. visit website: https://gsfresh.com/
2. Check the slide animation on the first page.



Actual results:

It looks very slow and rough, and the first page is not generally comfortable with movement; CPU usage is also seen as relatively slightly higher than other pages and other websites.

[Affected platforms]:
Platforms: Windows 8 / 8.1 , Windows 7, Windows 10
GPU's : AMD Rx550, Intel HD 5500, Nvidia GeForce 730

[Steps to reproduce]
1. Launch the Firefox browser and set both gfx.webrender.enabled, gfx.webrender.software = true

canvas.toDataURI() takes 3x as long in Firefox as in Chrome (with most time spent in MOZ_Z_deflate_slow),"Created attachment 9234995

STR:
1. Load attached testcase.
2. Inspect your web console to see how long the data URI serialization of the canvas took.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
In Chrome, the duration is approximately 30ms.
In Firefox, the duration is approximately 100ms.

These durations are pretty reliable for me; I can reload the page and the measurement stays the same.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Performance on-par with Chrome.

"scrolling with scrollwheel moves very slowly down the page, at nuro.ai","STR:
1. Visit https://www.nuro.ai/
2. Scroll down until you see the text ""Here to make your everyday a little better"", with a pizza-delivery video playing below it.  Position that text at the top of your viewport (with the video mostly filling the viewport).
3. Use your mousewheel to try to continue scrolling, paying attention to how many times you have to spin the wheel.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
The mousewheel scrolling velocity reduces here (and elsewhere on the page, but it's especially noticeable here). In particular, it takes many more mousewheel scrolls to get past this video on Firefox vs. Chrome. (About 8 wheel-scrolls in Firefox, vs. 2 in Chrome. I'm defining a wheel-scroll as the largest individual scroll that I can do with the wheel, i.e. starting my finger at the top of the wheel, and rolling that point all the way back. )

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Shouldn't have to mousewheel-scroll so many times. Should get the same experience as in Chrome.",Performance

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:104.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/104.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Boot into an Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS* live USB.
2. Connect to the Internet.
3. `sudo snap refresh firefox` to install the latest version of Firefox.
4. Open Firefox.
5. Navigate to https://www.wikipedia.org/

* I was also able to reproduce this problem on a Kubuntu 22.04.1 LTS live USB as well.  It happens regardless of whether Firefox is running from Snap, Flatpak, or DEB.  This issue is also reproducible on all past versions of Nightly as far back as the common TLS ciphers of https://www.wikipedia.org/ will allow.


Actual results:

As the site is loading, notice that there is a blank page for a few seconds while the indeterminate blue progress bar bounces.  The page then loads quickly after this delay.

The profiler shows that most of the time is spent on the `FcConfigCompareValue` function from the `libfontconfig.so.1` resource.  See the attached profile for more details.

"System font rasterization on macOS 11+ slows down page load, tab opening and tab switching, take 2","This is a follow-up to bug 1683975, which only fixed part of the problem.

---

The default new tab page displays some text, for example in the Pocket suggestions. This text uses the system font.
With WebRender, we seem to be re-rasterizing system font glyphs on every new tab. Creating system fonts seems to be particularly slow on Big Sur. This delays the paint of the new tab by 100ms.

Loading pages that use system fonts, for example github or  stackoverflow, also incurs this issue.
Tab switching can also hit this, for tabs that haven't been painted in a while.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Open a new Firefox window, and navigate to mozilla.org.
 2. Press Cmd+T to open a new tab.
 3. Press Cmd+T again to open another new tab.

Build ID: 20151221154602

Steps to reproduce:

Current Behavior:  
Whenever messages fail to send with EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK, Firefox queues up a SendDeferredMessages callback using mDeferTimeout and a one-shot nsITimer. This callback tries to drain the buffer completely. The initial value of mDeferTimeout is 10 ms.
- If the buffer is now empty (i.e., Firefox sent everything to SCTP), the function ends. We’re done here. Note that mDeferTimeout is not modified. It “becomes an estimate of how long we need to wait next time we block,” to quote the source code.
- If at least one packet was sent but the buffer still has data, the timer is requeued. The new mDeferTimeout is max(mDeferTimeout – 1, 10 ms).
- If no packets were sent, the timer is requeued. The new mDeferTimeout is min(mDeferTimeout + 1, 50 ms).

"WebVR latency is high, even when Framerate is sustained","In recent testing, it appears that intermittently the latency of WebVR is very high (feels like ~30-100 frames of latency).

This is affecting Nightly (ff57), Beta (ff56), and Release (ff55).

The effect is visible even when frames are not being dropped, possibly indicating an IPC latency issue or other similar logic problem related to frame timing.

The issue intermittently disappears, resulting in expected low-latency operation.

It appears to be only occuring for our OpenVR backend, with HTC Vive.  On the same machine, Oculus does not appear to be impacted.  (Perhaps there is a change of behavior in OpenVR updates, causing the bug to appear?)

When the latency is high, the room scale boundaries drawn by the SteamVR compositor still appear to have low-latency, with a noticeable drift in the WebVR rendering when looking at the ground.

performance regression in chalkboard benchmark (https://testdrive-archive.azurewebsites.net/performance/chalkboard/),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0

Steps to reproduce:

1) go to https://testdrive-archive.azurewebsites.net/performance/chalkboard/ run a benchmark and compare the results with a nightly before https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1699790


Actual results:

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1699790 has landed. I did a mozregression and found this https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/pushloghtml?fromchange=d08490cb7ac70c79a200ad93effef91d2570f793&tochange=8350638712cf491cbdabc5ed1cf2f72139daed12


Expected results:

https://www.vsynctester.com/gputest.html benchmark should have improved without degrading performance of chalkboard test. I also tested the vsynctester with and without https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1699790 I got similar results where in chalkboard I get worse results.",Performance
Multiple UI refreshes degrade performance of CSV Import,"Created attachment 9212195
Screencast 2021-03-29 02_22_27.mp4

**[Notes]**:
- Importing a CSV file with 1000 logins takes between 3 to 10 minutes. During the import, there are multiple performance issues that can be observed. The performance issues get worse after ~800/1000 logins are imported. Here are a few examples of performance issues observed:
	- Firefox can’t navigate to any page using the address bar until all logins have been imported.
	- The top sites from the new tab, cannot be opened while the CSV file is imported. If one of the top sites is clicked, then a new tab is opened, the page remains blank until the logins are imported.
	- In certain cases, Firefox also freezes. This happens after a few minutes while the importing process is about to end (when ~850 logins are imported).
	- If the about:logins page is closed while importing a CSV file then if it's reopened, the page remains blank until all the logins are imported..
	- The hover effect has a delay.
	- Opening new tabs or Firefox menus have a delay.

- Considering the fact that this is a performance issue we have captured a performance profile using the Firefox Profiler addon on multiple machines:
	- Windows 10 x64, Intel Core i7 - 10750H, 16 GB RAM: https://share.firefox.dev/3u4cXve
	- macBook Pro (Early 2015), macOS 10.15.7, Intel Core i5, 8 GB RAM: https://share.firefox.dev/3sBkKA8 
	- Linux Mint 20, AMD FX (™) - 8320, 16 GB RAM: https://share.firefox.dev/3lZd60d 
	- Windows 10 x64, Intel Core i5-6500, 16 GB RAM: https://share.firefox.dev/3m2iNKK
	
**[Affected versions]:**
- Firefox Nightly 89.0a1 (Build ID:20210328213901);
- Firefox Beta 88.0b (Build ID: 20210328185936)

**[Affected Platforms]:**
- Windows 10 x64;
- macOS 10.15.7;
- Linux Mint 20 x64;

**[Prerequisites]:**
- Have the latest Firefox Beta build installed.
- Have a large CSV file that contains multiple logins or you can use this one (1004 logins): [file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HMMTMlOfgNT3LFOfFn6zTEd6_sE41LQy/view?usp=sharing).

**[Steps to reproduce]:**
1. Open the Firefox browser with the profile from prerequisites.
2. Navigate to the ""about:logins"" page.
3. Open the menu, click the ""Import from a file..."" option.
4. Select and import the CSV file described in perquisites.
5. Wait until ~800 logins are imported.
6. Open a new tab, click on the top sites, navigate to multiple websites.
7. Open different Firefox menus and click on options.
8. Observe how the browser behaves.

**[Expected result]:**
 There are no noticeable performance issues.

**[Actual result]:**
- Different performance issues can be observed.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open this [link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=UNCONFIRMED&bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&f1=classification&field0-0-0=product&field0-0-1=component&field0-0-2=alias&field0-0-3=short_desc&field0-0-4=status_whiteboard&field0-0-5=cf_crash_signature&o1=notequals&query_format=advanced&type0-0-0=substring&type0-0-1=substring&type0-0-2=substring&type0-0-3=substring&type0-0-4=substring&type0-0-5=substring&v1=Graveyard&value0-0-0=process&value0-0-1=process&value0-0-2=process&value0-0-3=process&value0-0-4=process&value0-0-5=process&order=changeddate%20DESC%2Cbug_status%2Cpriority%2Cassigned_to%2Cbug_id&limit=0) of a bugzilla search result.

2. Search for ` render`. The space at the start of the search parameter is important.


Actual results:

The initial search results and the subsequent findings of the next occurrences take several seconds. The ""tab spinner"" shows up if you switch to another tab while the search is in progress.


Expected results:

It should be as fast as the results without the space at the start of the search param.

Poor style calculation performance for attribute selectors compared to class selectors,"Created attachment 9215142
index.html

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/89.0.4389.114 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to http://bl.ocks.org/nolanlawson/raw/40ad8bfdf8e50705a5ab35599bccf826/?mode=attributes&rules=1000
2. Click ""Force style recalc""


Actual results:

The duration of style/layout/render as measured by the benchmark is ~190ms on my MacBook Pro running Firefox 87.0.


Expected results:

In Safari 14.0.3, the same benchmark measures ~15ms on the same machine.

Below is a description of the benchmark:

This page is a small benchmark that demonstrates that attribute selectors are much slower than class selectors in terms of the style/layout/render step, when using the following patterns:

Attributes:

    [data-foo] div { }

Classes:

    .foo div { }

To represent a non-trivial page, the benchmark constructs a DOM tree with ~3,000 div elements. It also adds 1,000 (non-matching) CSS rules with the given pattern to a <style> tag.

In the upper-right-hand corner, the page reports the number of milliseconds it took to run the style/layout/render process (measured using rAF+postMessage). Clicking ""Force style recalc"" also forces a recalc and re-measures.

The benchmark allows you to vary the number of rules, and also to use class selectors rather than attribute selectors. E.g. here is 100 rules using class selectors: http://bl.ocks.org/nolanlawson/raw/40ad8bfdf8e50705a5ab35599bccf826/?mode=classes&rules=100

This benchmark demonstrates that Firefox has a steep performance cliff for attribute selectors, but not class selectors:

Attributes:

- 100 rules: ~25ms
- 1000 rules: ~190ms
- 10000 rules: ~1800ms

Classes:

- 100 rules: ~5ms
- 1000 rules: ~7ms
- 10000 rules: ~7ms

Whereas Safari has much less of a performance cliff for attribute selectors:

- 100 rules: ~10ms
- 1000 rules: ~20ms
- 10000 rules: ~72ms

Note that in the above, I'm measuring the performance when clicking ""Force style recalc."" The initial style/layout/render costs may be different.

Also note that I filed the same bug on Chrome, as their performance is worse than Firefox's: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1196474 .

Attached is an index.html file containing the same benchmark, but note that the query params matter when loading the page.",Performance
Firefox falsely claims it supports the first-input and event performance entry types,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/90.0.4430.93 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Run the following code in the developer console:

```
console.log(PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes.includes('first-input'));
console.log('PerformanceEventTiming' in self);
```




Actual results:

The following is logged:

// true
// false


Expected results:

Both log statements should be the same (either true or false).

The different means that Firefox passes feature detects for the First Input Delay as well as Event Timing usage, but it does not actually support it.

Note: this issue just seems to affect Firefox 88, when testing Firefox 89 it works as expected.",Performance
Degraded performance after upgrading to Firefox 89 on Linux,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0

Steps to reproduce:

FIrefox is using significantly more CPU after upgrading from Firefox 88 to 89. The increased CPU is noticeable on loading any page, typing into the address bar, and typing into a text box like this bug report.


Actual results:

As I type this, the main Firefox process is using over 100% of one CPU and the other Firefox processes are each using around 12%. 

If I load https://www.ozbargain.com.au, the main process uses around 240% for several seconds, and the remaining processes around 25%.

Consequently my laptop is running hotter and the fan makes a lot of noise every time I load a new page.


Expected results:

Lower CPU. I will downgrade to Firefox 88 to try to get some comparative numbers.",Performance

"Attachment pane layout breaks upon toggling pane and/or resizing in message reader with many attachments, covered/hidden by grey area, unusable","Created attachment 9146875
Screenshot 1: attachment pane unusable, items hidden behind grey area

Is anyone seeing this?

Seen on Windows 10, TB 78.0a1 (2020-05-08) (64-bit)
Completely unusable for me (see screenshot).

- some more attachments in a draft, save draft (not sure if draft matters, guess not)
- look at draft in message reader
- use attachment pane twisty and/or resize the attachment pane vertically

actual result

- as you drag splitter upwards, grey area follows from bottom and covers attachments instead of revealing them in the bigger space
- grey area will not go away even when you close twisty

expected
- see more attachments",Other

STR:
1. Enter a query in the Urlbar that would cause synced tab results to appear. Just searching the open tabs restriction character, ""%"", is probably easiest.
2. Shrink the window horizontally until you pass the threshold where 2-line results would appear in the Urlbar.

All the synced tab results disappear. They reappear when the window is expanded.",Other
[Context Menu] Redesigned new-tab page should display context menu button for all discovery stream layouts,"STR:
 1. Open a new tab.

 2. Decide that one of the 3 ""Recommended by Pocket"" stories isn't something you want to be looking at. (Perhaps it's politically/emotionally charged, or it's a sponsored story for something that doesn't interest you, or it's just not your thing.)

 3. See if you can dismiss that story to make your new-tab page feel more friendly/tailored-to-your-needs.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
As far as I can tell, there's no way to dismiss individual stories right now, after the redesign that was preffed on in bug 1523703. (They used to be dismissable via a hover menu, in the previously shipping design of this page, but the hover menu doesn't show up anymore.)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
We should still allow users to dismiss individual suggestions.",Other
New-tab page has some kinda-slow synchronous flexbox/grid layout,"STR:
 0. Install profiler from https://profiler.firefox.com/
 1. Visit about:blank.
 2. Ctrl+Shift+1 to start profiling.
 3. Ctrl+T to open a new tab.
 4. After a few seconds, Ctrl+Shift+2 to stop profiling.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Profile shows a red bar for a period of jank, which includes some flexbox layout.  In particular, there are some script-triggered sync reflows from an IntersectionObserver callback which checks `.clientWidth`, which I suspect are associated with image lazy-loading.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
I suspect the series of short script/IntersectionObserver-triggered reflows should probably be cheap or free, because layout is probably not changing much.  I'm not sure whether the tiles are styled such that we can theoretically infer that the flex containers involved don't need to reflow, or if there's styling that we would need to add (along with optimizations) to reliably get that result -- but one way or another, we should try to be sure that no serious reflow work needs to happen after the initial layout.

Also/alternatively, perhaps the about:newtab code shouldn't be reading clientWidth in the IntersectionObserver callback, since that forces any of the callback's earlier restyling to be immediately flushed. We're probably not coalescing these multiple IntersectionObserver-callback-invocations' restyling at all right now, due to the fact that they're doing this flush.

Here's a profile I captured of the STR, using current Nightly: https://perfht.ml/2SWyogu (filtered for nsFlexContainerFrame)
The series of 9 reflows (each 2-3ms long) after timestamp 1.64s are the ones that I'm primarily concerned with improving/avoiding.",Other

Layout doesn't remember the open/closed status of Box Model correctly when switching nodes,"This might be a dupe, I remember seeing a bug about this but can't find it right now. Maybe we fixed it but not completely?

## Test case
https://codepen.io/fvsch/pen/yLBMEwe

```html
<section>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>
</section>

<style>
section {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  margin: 2rem;
  border: 4px solid;
  padding: 1rem;
  gap: 1rem;
}

section > div {
  display: flex;
  width: 5rem;
  height: 5rem;
  background-color: blue;
}
</style>
```

## Steps to reproduce

1. Open test case and inspect one of the blue squares
2. In Layout, 4 panes are showing. Close every pane except the last one, ""Box Model"".
3. Select the parent node, `<section>`.

Expected result:
Layout now shows 3 panes:
- ""Flex Container"", closed
- ""Grid"", closed
- ""Box Model"", open

Actual result:
Layout now shows 3 panes:
- ""Flex Container"", closed
- ""Grid"", closed
- ""Box Model"", closed

The box model pane should be opened, not closed.

## What's going on?

We remember the open/closed status of Layout accordion panes as an array of booleans, instead of remembering the state of each pane by name. This matters because we don't always show the same panes at the same index:

- Index 0: ""Flexbox"" or ""Flex Container""
- Index 1: ""Flex Item of …"" or ""Grid""
- Index 2: ""Grid"" or ""Box Model""
- Index 3: ""Box Model"" or undefined

Looking at preferences in about:config, I'm seeing individual booleans for:

```
devtools.layout.boxmodel.opened	
devtools.layout.flexbox.opened	
devtools.layout.grid.opened
```

(Are we missing one for flexbox, since we have 2 flexbox-related panes? Or does it not matter much that we remember each separately?)

This seems encouraging, but we probably mess it up in `devtools/client/inspector/layout/components/Accordion.js` when we store a local state of ""are accordion panes opened or not"" as an array of booleans here:

```js
this.state = {
  opened: props.items.map(item => item.opened),
};
```

We probably need to keep track of opened accordion content by name, and not by index.",Other
Text disappears when changing page layout on html files with multiple frames,"[Affected versions]
Firefox Nightly 70.0a1

[Affected platforms]
Windows 7/10 (64-bit)
Ubuntu 18.04

[Steps to reproduce]
1. Launch Firefox Nightly
2. Download html file from https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BzOV3ybvBASXVlV1aE5ZMmRkYzQ/view 
3. Open the printing_vertical_frames.html in a new window
4. Open the hamburger-menu and click on Print
5. In print-preview mode change layout to landscape

[Expected result]
Page should be set in landscape and the text should be visible.

[Actual Result]

Bug 1568055 seems to be the culprit.
Nika, could you take a look?",Other
The devtools.layout.flexbox.opened preference does not match the Layout UI,"We save the ""Flexbox"" accordion's opened/closed state as a single preference (`devtools.layout.flexbox.opened`), but we have 3 different Flexbox-related accordions:

- ""Flexbox"" (show a message: ""Select a flex container or item to continue"")
- ""Flex Container"": when selected node is a flex container
- ""Flex Item of …"": when selected node is a flex item

Currently, when we create the Layout tab, all these accordion items are rendered opened or closed by reading the value of `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened`. When the user opens or closes one of those accordion items, we also toggle the value of the `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened` preference.

Now that we fixed bug 1576604, this system works well when only showing one of the accordion items at a time, but when showing two (for nodes which are flex containers + flex items) the mismatch between the UI (two accordion items) and the preference (a single flag) can cause issues.

## Scenario where the current implementation works

STR:
1. In about:config, set `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened` to the default value (true).
2. Go to https://codepen.io/fvsch/pen/yLBMEwe
3. Right-click a pink circle and select ""Inspect Element""
4. In the Layout tab, close the ""Flex Item of …"" tab
5. Close the toolbox (F12)
6. Right-click a pink circle and select ""Inspect Element""

Expected and actual result:
- The ""Flex Item of …"" accordion item is closed

Open question:
- If we add a step #7 which is to use the Markup view to select the parent element (blue square), what would users expect then? Should both ""Flex Container"" and ""Flex Item of …"" be closed? Or should ""Flex Item of …"" be closed, but ""Flex Container"" remains opened?

## Scenario where it breaks

STR:
1. In about:config, set `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened` to the default value (true).
2. Go to https://codepen.io/fvsch/pen/yLBMEwe
3. Right-click a blue square and select ""Inspect Element""
4. In the Layout tab, close the ""Flex Container"" tab
5. Close the toolbox (F12)
6. Right-click a blue square and select ""Inspect Element""

Expected result:
- The ""Flex Container"" item is closed
- The ""Flex Item of …"" item is open

Actual result:
- The ""Flex Container"" item is closed
- The ""Flex Item of …"" item is __closed__

## Solutions

To me this is an information architecture issue.
I can picture two different solutions:

1. Put all the Flexbox-related content in a single accordion item (""Flexbox"").
2. Treat each Flexbox-related item as its own entity, with an associated preference:
   - `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened`
   - `devtools.layout.flex-container.opened`
   - `devtools.layout.flex-item.opened`
(Or maybe use `devtools.layout.flexbox.opened` for both the empty message and the Flex Container section?)

In the short term, #2 looks more practical. Reorganizing the Flexbox content to fit in a single accordion item with sub-sections would require some UX work that's maybe best spent on exploring the [Unified Layout Panel](https://github.com/firefox-devtools/ux/issues/64)?",Other

Layout can‘t adjust for mobile view and keep desktop view in Fenix. I'm sure ""Request Desktop Site"" is disabled and never switched on.


Expected results:

VuePress layout auto adjust for mobile view. Not to keep desktop view. In Chrome for Android and legacy Firefox for Android (org.mozilla.firefox) everything work properly.",Other

KeyPress composition payload tracking could be more reliable (it's not handling pending style / layout flushes),"Created attachment 9187934
testcase without style flush

We have profiler markers and telemetry instrumentation for key press latency. However, sometimes this instrumentation fails to capture data about a keypress, because of [this `driver->ViewManagerFlushIsPending()` check](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/c37038c592a352eda0f5e77dfb58c4929bf8bcd3/dom/events/EventDispatcher.cpp#1102): If the keypress only touched styles, then no view manager flush has been scheduled yet. Only a refresh tick has been scheduled. Then, during the tick, styles will be flushed and a view manager flush will be enqueued at that point.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. Open the testcase.
 2. Start the profiler.
 3. With the testcase focused, type on the keyboard.
 4. Capture the profile.
 5. Look for ""KeyPress Payload Presented"" markers on the compositor thread.

Expected results:
There should be a payload for every keypress.

Actual results:
No payloads. Profile: https://share.firefox.dev/2IFnzOM",Other
Picture-in-picture hotkey doesn't work in Russian keyboard layout,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0

Steps to reproduce:

To reproduce the issue you need to have Russian keyboard layout in Windows.

- open https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KphWsnhZ4Ag
- start playing the movie
- ensure your keyboard layout is set to ENG
- press Ctrl + Shift + ] to open picture-to-picture
- it's opened (that works fine)
- close picture-to-picture
- change keyboard layout to RUS
- press Ctrl + Shift + ] to open picture-to-picture



Actual results:

picture-to-picture separate window doesn't appear on RUS keyboard layout


Expected results:

picture-to-picture separate window appears (despite selected keyboard layout).

For example, hotkeys like Ctrl + T to open a new tab works in spite of selected keyboard layout. Youtube default hotkey (Shift + >) works in spite of keyboard layout.
So it seems it's possible to make this particular hotkey working as well.",Other
"""N sheets of paper"" badge subtly influences the layout of the whole print dialog","Created attachment 9170864
screencast of bug (watch the positions of the ""Print"" title, etc. as the N Sheets badge disappears & reappears)

STR:
 1. Do something that causes the ""n sheets of paper"" badge to disappear.  (I'm assuming this is a thing that is expected to happen sometimes.)

(For example: if you're in a local build with bug 1653389's patches applied, you can get the badge to hide by entering an invalid value for the Scale or the Page Range fields. Otherwise, e.g. if you're in today's nightly which doesn't have bug 1653389's patches, you might have to use Browser Toolbox or something else to hide this badge.)

 2. Watch how the UI changes when you do that.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
When the badge disappears, the position of **everything in the dialog** (the ""Print"" title, the ""Destination"" title & dropdown, etc) **shifts upwards slightly**.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Layout should remain the same. Positions should not shift.

It seems the badge is propping up the positions of everything below it, by virtue of being the largest thing in its container/line/whatever.  Or something like that.

Screencast attached.  Note: as mentioned in the STR, I'm assuming that this badge is something that's actually meant to be occasionally hidden -- but if for some reason the hiding here is accidental & the badge is really meant to remain visible all the time, then perhaps this is a non-issue.",Other

Pocket layout is bad for printed media,"Created attachment 9187072
screenshot 1 (Chrome)

**STEPS TO REPRODUCE**
1. load https://getpocket.com/explore/item/the-hidden-signs-that-can-reveal-a-fake-photo
2. Print (or Print Preview) the page

**ACTUAL RESULTS**
There are several layout errors that can be easily avoided with a print stylesheet.

The first problem is that pretty much the entire content of the page is put inside as CSS grid container with a single row, which currently doesn't fragment very well in Firefox.  We're working on implementing a fallback mechanism for edge cases like this in bug 1640197 and bug 1665214.  However, there are good reasons for why you should try to avoid triggering that edge case even after we fix those bugs.

Consider for example ""screenshot 1"" which is from Print Preview **in Chrome**.  The text on the last line are split vertically halfway through on some pages.  This is because Chrome also falls back to ""slicing"" rather than using [proper CSS fragmentation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-break/#breaking-rules). (Firefox will have similar layout (slicing) after we fix the aforementioned bugs.)

The second problem can also be seen in ""screenshot 1"": the ""sign up for Pocket newsletter"" box (which has `position:fixed`) is replicated on every single page, which is [correct per CSS](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-position/#fixed-position), but pretty much always undesirable.  In this case you can see that is overlaps the article content on page 2 and forward.

The third problem is that the navigation/login bar at the top is printed, which should usually be avoided.

The fourth problem is that the advertisement at the top is printed, which should usually be avoided.

The fifth problem is that the ""Discover More Topics"" and ""Products/Company info"" footer(s) at the bottom is printed, which should usually be avoided.

**EXPECTED RESULTS**
Problem 2 to 5 can be fixed with a simple `@media print { selector { display:none } }` rule with a selector that matches those elements.

Problem 1 can be avoided by not using a grid container in print mode.  Currently it's a 3-column grid layout, with ""share toolbar"" in the left column, the article itself in the second column, and advertisements in the third column.  It appears that the content in the first and third column are suppressed when printed, which is good.  This means that the top `<article>` element can be made a `display:block` instead of `display:grid` in the print stylesheet.  This will make it fragment much nicer since it will use the natural break opportunities in the article contents (i.e. between lines, blocks etc).",Other
Support playout-delay RTP header extension,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_14_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/77.0.3865.90 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

A WebRTC client offers to send video media and enables the following RTP header extension, by setting the following SDP attribute in its offer:

a=extmap:6 http://www.webrtc.org/experiments/rtp-hdrext/playout-delay


Actual results:

The FireFox client removes this attribute in the answer sent back.



Expected results:

Expectation is for the playout-delay attribute to not be removed from the answer and for the browser to honor this extension.

This extension is confirmed to work properly in Chrome and Safari. Therefore the Chromium based WebRTC stack fully supports it.

Inspecting the Gecko repository confirms that the WebRTC stack itself appears to support this RTP header extension. However, the separate signaling library used to conduct the SDP handshake currently does not include support for it.

I have personally tested a simple patch to the signaling code in Gecko to confirm that when enabled, the extension actually performs as expected. I would be happy to productize and submit this patch.

This is a bit difficult to test because to my knowledge there currently are no WebRTC products out there relying on this extension. We are in the process of adding this to our own solution (PhenixRTS), which is how we discovered this issue, and would like to be able to include Gecko based browsers to our list of supported platforms.",Other

What happens is that

- Orca calls SetCaretOffset for an object which has disappeared.
- Normally, at-spi2-atk's impl_SetCaretOffset would in such case just not find the object,
- but there is a window between Accessible::Shutdown() (which resets the SelectionManager cache) and HyperTextAccessible::~HyperTextAccessible() during which the Accessible still exists.
- If the SetCaretOffset request comes during the window, when SetCaretOffset calls SelectionManager::UpdateCaretOffset, the object gets referenced in the SelectionManager cache. This can be seen in this backtrace: I have put a pause() call there under if (aItem->GetContent() == NULL || aItem->Document() == NULL), i.e. aItem got shutdown, but it is not destroyed yet, thus atk found it.

- When the object actually gets destroyed from nsCycleCollector_doDeferredDeletion, ~HyperTextAccessible() is called but does nothing, so the object remains referenced from the SelectionManager cache. This shows up in this backtrace (I have put a pause() call under if SelectionMgr()->AccessibleWithCaret(nullptr) == this, i.e. the object being destroyed is actually referenced by the SelectionMgr cache)

- From then on, if Orca requests get CaretOffset, HyperTextAccessible::CaretOffset gets the object from the cache, and tries to call GetNode on it, which crashes (first backtrace shown above).



Expected results:

It should not crash :)

The proposed patch modifies HyperTextAccessible::SetCaretOffset to avoid forcing the cache refresh when the object has been shut down, just not collected yet. I guess other strategies could be to remove the object from the SelectionManager cache, or to make Accessible::Shutdown() remove the object from sight of at-spi2-atk's.",Other

Firefox Developers Edition 54.0a2 crashes when using browser.tabs.update(),"Created attachment 8864916
js_crashing.zip

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170413192749

Steps to reproduce:

I'm using Windows 7 Professional, so some instructions may apply only to that OS.

1. Unzip the attached js_crashing.zip. This is a test add-on.
2. Run ""web-ext run"" on the unzipped test add-on. Or run the ""firefox_run_debug.bat"".
3. It should just automatically open Firefox Dev Edition with the add-on loaded in. 
4. Open the ""test.js"" in a text editor.
5. Just outright do a Save action, or add a whitespace at the very end of the file and save.



Actual results:

Firefox Dev Edition just closes itself. I'm assuming it is a hard crash, as I don't see anything happening otherwise.


Expected results:

Either throw log errors, or updates the tab specified in the code. Either way, it should not just close itself immediately.",Other

Expected results:

It should not crash :-)

Actually I am restricted to the released version of Firefox 42.0.1 (because I am using xulrunner), so I am not looking for a bug-fix (it is probably fixed already), I am looking to understand what caused the crash, so I can find a work-around in JavaScript to avoid the crash in the first place.",Other
Firefox 57 Beta crashes on Mac OS when run under sandbox-exec,"Created attachment 8925914

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_12_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/62.0.3202.75 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I'm running FF 57 Beta on Sierra & High Sierra with mac os sandbox functionality. Is there a way to disable the firefox inbuilt sandbox so that I can use macos sandbox.

I'm trying to run the firefox with below command
/usr/bin/sandbox-exec  -f /<my-sandbox-path>/sandbox.sb /Applications/Firefox.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin


Actual results:

Currently with sandbox enabled, whenever I try to launch FF 57 beta or make any search in new tab, I'm seeing the below error in system logs and tab crashes(screenshot attached)

""kernel[0]: Sandbox: plugin-container(92759) deny forbidden-sandbox-reinit""


Expected results:

Firefox should have launched properly honouring the macos sandbox rules.",Other

==12297== Your program just tried to execute an instruction that Valgrind

==12297== 1. Your program has a bug and erroneously jumped to a non-code

==12297==    warning about a bad jump, it's probably your program's fault.

==12297==    i.e. it's Valgrind's fault.  If you think this is the case or
==12297==    you are not sure, please let us know and we'll try to fix it.

Steps to reproduce:

Unfortunately there is no specific action that causes the crash.I am guessing it happens right when an ajax call is being made. It must be a combination of things since i tested only having a simple ajax call and that didnt crash. 
crash happens in random places.

"Thunderbird randomly ""crashes"" (closes window, process remains active)","Created attachment 8766748
Backtrace with GDB after bug occurred

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0
Build ID: 20160607080223

Steps to reproduce:

I couldn't yet make out a patter for this, it just happens sometimes to any kind of action on my part (closing a message window, clicking on a folder, etc.).


Actual results:

The Thunderbird window just closes (along with any other of its windows), but the process is still running (status ""S""). Nothing is printed to STDOUT/STDERR.

I've retrieved and attached a backtrace, but it's without symbols so probably not of too much use. If you have any suggestions for getting more helpful information, please tell me!


Expected results:

The window only closes when I close it.

rapidly change directory twice when saving file = crash,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; SunOS i86pc; rv:45.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/45.0
Build ID: 20160926190039

Steps to reproduce:

Use a directory tree with enough files such that alternate directories can selected before the directory listing is complete. NFS is slower but the crash is not limited to NFS, what matters is directory listing takes enough time.

Save a file, Firefox opens a dialogue box with a directory based on previous saves but is wrong, select the directory above, *before* the directory listing is complete select the directory above again (now 2 above initial).  Select the second directory while the intermediate listing is forming (quickly).  Result is a crash.  This might not be the only way to trigger the crash but it does repeatably cause a crash.


Actual results:

Crash.

"Firefox suddenly loses internet connection, and hangs on shutdown (crashes as shutdownhang)","Since earlier today I have found that after about 10 minutes or less of using Firefox that suddenly for no apparent reason pages will refuse to load any contents, and although Firefox does not take me to the page which says it can't reach the site, it doesn't manage to load anything as though its internet connection has suddenly been lost. It won't even let me check for updates for plugins and gives an error for that. I have tested with other applications such as ping and the internet connection is fine, it's just Firefox which loses it.

I have noticed that when I run firefox from Terminal that this is the output to begin with:

    1482487989643 addons.webextension.firefox@ghostery.com WARN Loading extension 'firefox@ghostery.com': Reading manifest: Error processing background.persistent: Event pages are not currently supported. This will run as a persistent background page.

    Promise resolved after context unloaded

Then when the problem starts to occur, I find that the only way to resolve it, if even for a short period, is to restart the browser, so I tell Firefox to quit, however although the window does close, the process carries on and this is the output:

    tabs.onRemoved event fired after context unloaded.
    tabs.onRemoved event fired after context unloaded.

I am running Ubuntu GNOME 16.10 with GNOME 3.22 and Firefox 50. Although I am sad to say this, if I don't find a solution for this issue soon I am at least temporarily going to have to switch browsers because Firefox is seriously becoming unusable with this issue.

test case: cell-position.html

This bug was filed from the Socorro interface and is 
report bp-8723787d-9696-448c-b909-317e32170317.
=============================================================

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load the attached test case
2. Launch accerciser and locate the table cell in the list of accessibles
3. Having selected the cell, type the following in accerciser's ipython console:

acc.queryTableCell().get_position()

Expected results: Firefox would not crash

Actual results: Firefox always crashes

Other notes: In order to reproduce this using the steps in this report, you will also need to get the latest at-spi2-core package because of https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=779835",Other

Build ID: 20170316213829

Steps to reproduce:

1. Start with a current macOS system that does not have an audio device.

2. Do anything that makes a sound (play a YouTube video).



Actual results:

The tab crashes.


Expected results:

Normal operation should continue (without sound, obviously).",Other
TB crashes upon ExQuilla connection,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.12; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0
Build ID: 20170330120906

Steps to reproduce:

I opened TBird and it automatically connected to search for messages. ExQuilla hadn't worked for a while and, suddenly, it worked and tried to connect.


Actual results:

A crash window opened telling me TBird has closed unexpectedly, even though it hadn't. After that, it seemed like every time ExQuilla connected, the same crash window would appear.


Expected results:

Regular connection. When I switched the account to manual, the crash stopped, but it'll come back when I force-update the account to get new emails.",Other

I tried turning off ""Use hardware acceleration when available"" but it didn't make a difference.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Open codewars.com.
2. See Firefox crashes.

I tried to open it using Trident via some plugins (IE Tab and similar) and it worked fine, so it's HTML/CSS rendering engine issue. I also disabled JS, so it's not JS issue.

Starting two profiles at the same time crashes the OS and Firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 4.4.2; GT-I9301I Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/61.0.3163.98 Mobile Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I installed Firefox 57.0.3 with no configurations, extensions or themes. I created two profiles. And in order to start them at the same time I added the --no-remote option when starting Firefox.


Actual results:

After opening some tabs in both profiles, the tabs start to crash and freeze. Also my OS starts to lag and some system components crash too.


Expected results:

When enabling --no-remote option, Firefox should have opened both profiles at the same time with no issues, so the user could use e.g. home profile together with a work profile.",Other

Steps to reproduce:

I have originally reported this as
https://bugzilla.opensuse.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1043811 but I have been
also able to reproduce it with self-built Firefox Nightly, git
revision 9392a406040ac4f41077c21d4a45b1030302bf48 (from October 26
2017, I was told I would need a newer rust than available in openSUSE
for a newer revision so I did not even attempt to build a newer one).
On stock openSUSE Firefox, this has been happening for over six
months.

In short, Firefox crashes on openSUSE Linux when ulimit -Ss is too
large.

Firefox slow to the point of constant freezes and crashes,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/46.0.2486.0 Safari/537.36 Edge/13.10586

Steps to reproduce:

1. Run Firefox.


Actual results:

As of late (this has actually been going on for a while, but it only seems to get worse with every version), Firefox is getting ridiculously slow and CPU consuming, to the point where it keeps freezing every couple of seconds, crashing, and usually also taking huge amounts of RAM with it.

The number of tabs or their content does not seem to matter at all.

When running a fresh copy of Firefox (using the Refresh option), this still happens.

However, when running in Safe Mode, it doesn't happen, and Firefox works as smooth as it used to.

At the same time, if I don't run in safe mode, and instead manually go and disable all extensions and plugins, which is presumably what safe mode does, this issue still happens.

Beside running in safe mode, I couldn't find any solution or setting that helped mitigate the issue.

I am not sure what more information I can give, or what files I should attach.


Expected results:

Steps to reproduce:


Just normal surfing activity resulting in crashes. I have tried the following

1. Firefox crashes intermittent. Other programs and/or browsers as well but mostly Firefox.

2. I cannot tell if the same thing occurs in safe mode since it is intermittent

3. ran memtest86+ on the RAM and found lots of errors. Replaced RAM and that seemed to do the trick for about a week. Crashes began again today. I ran memtest86+ again and found no errors (the same as after I replaced all RAM).

4. ran a couple of virus/malware checkers and found nothing

5. I am running fully updated windows XP pro

6. Last crash report ID is: bp-6ce225be-36ff-4e46-961a-3f2142160720 I have a copy of the raw data dump but it is too long to paste into this post 

Also I have done a clean reinstall of Firefox as well as tried the ""refresh"" firefox.

I do not have ""hardware acceleration"" enabled


I can add that today I ran a motherboard diagnostics tool and found no errors. I am including a copy of the file dump for one of the crashes.

A suggestion was made:
There was a recent lax in blocked NVIDIA drivers and I think that yours { webglRenderer: Google Inc. -- ANGLE (NVIDIA GeForce 6200 Direct3D9 vs_3_0 ps_3_0) } may fall under that category. 

Originally the blocklist entry blocked all versions less than version 8.17.11.8265 and since you already disabled hardware acceleration and it still happening we can file a bug here https://mzl.la/2a1qfUX

EDIT*
happy to assist with this, in the bug we will need an example url where this happens and the hardware, version (64bit or 32bit).

Actual results:

The whole Firefox freezes. This is reproducible.

When closing Firefox from the task manager and reopening it I'll get another problem: On the next restart Firefox often does not recognize the tabs it had open, so the about:session-restore page does not show any tabs.

Firefox Nightly 53.0a1 crashes with RenderBadPicture error,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:50.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/50.0
Build ID: 20161130210124

Steps to reproduce:

Using either a fresh profile, my own profile, or either even in Safe mode, I was able to produce a crash each time by simply opening Firefox, and selecting the Quit option from the dropdown hamburger menu.

I am running on ArchLinux 64bit and am building Firefox from a community maintained package on the Arch User Repository named firefox-nightly.



Actual results:

When the crash happens I receive this error in the terminal:

(firefox:2): Gdk-ERROR **: The program 'firefox' received an X Window System error.
This probably reflects a bug in the program.
The error was 'RenderBadPicture (invalid Picture parameter)'.
  (Details: serial 2842 error_code 143 request_code 139 (RENDER) minor_code 7)
  (Note to programmers: normally, X errors are reported asynchronously;
   that is, you will receive the error a while after causing it.
   To debug your program, run it with the GDK_SYNCHRONIZE environment
   variable to change this behavior. You can then get a meaningful
   backtrace from your debugger if you break on the gdk_x_error() function.)

Please note that this crash happens sporadically during normal browsing, but it seems to be the easiest to consistently reproduce using the steps outlined above.

Steps to reproduce:

Actual results:

Firefox crashed during loading of the addon, reporting that the ""ö"" utf8 char is an invalid control flag.




Expected results:

Firefox should load the addon without problems.

The reason for the crash was the missing BOM header in the message.json file. Firefox on MS Windows should check the BOM header in message.json files and if they are not existing, the file should be marked as invalid.",Other

Build ID: 20170522172523

Steps to reproduce:

On any site (experienced on Facebook, Gmail, OWA, and many others) select any button which prompts an upload-file dialog to open. 


Actual results:

Firefox crashes on the dialog opening - you can see the dialog for a split second before Firefox crashes altogether. It will continue to do this to no meaningful end, that is to say I have not uncovered a way to make it work which is not totally random. After multiple crashes it will eventually permit the upload dialog to work. 

(Attached are 3 different dumps, before posting here I tested this against the beta version of Firefox, and still had the issue - that dump is attached. [So, one is 54 branch, but the other 2 are 53 branch] An audio program from MSI called Nahimic I thought was the cause, but the most recent dump shows grooveex.dll as the crashing thread.)

If it is silly or not useful sharing the raw dump, the Crash ID's are:
Crash on 54 Branch: fd78733b-cdc7-4b55-a167-d79590170525

Steps to reproduce:

The installer says it is 4.42.0.0.  I don't know what that translates to your branch system.

Seems that my dad, who is legally blind, but can see the computer screen when the screen is magnified 200+%, accidentally upgraded (or maybe forced to?) to your most recent version of FF.  Have nothing but a headache ever since as he can't use the browser any more.

Just going to gmail.com crashes the browser.  But it's not just limited to that website. 
 I've submitted several crash reports under this email account.  Running Windows 7.  I've tried to Refresh FF.  Uninstall/Reinstall FF.  The only thing I've not gotten around to is to wipe FF and all related data off the machine and attempt to reinstall again.

If this can't be fixed ASAP, I'll just move to Chrome and not look back.  I and my father don't have time for this.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 5.1; rv:52.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/52.0
Build ID: 20180430140610

Steps to reproduce:

Crash submission always fails from sometime last year. I tested it last night using ""Nightly tester tools"" addon to crash Firefox manually.


Actual results:

First I tested whether it is due to the great firewall blocking. ""Nightly tester tools"" addon seems uses IE proxy setting instead of Firefox' proxy setting, so I set a wall breaker proxy in IE proxy setting. Submission still failed, but the error log changed from ""An error occurred in the secure channel support"" (or sometimes ""A connection with the server could not be established"") to ""The server returned an invalid or unrecognized response"". So it seems not related to blocking.

Second I captured net packets using Wireshark. The error happened right after secure connection attempts to crash-reports.mozilla.com, which is resolved to 34.212.223.156, one as TLSv1 and another as SSLv3, and both failed as ""Handshake failure"". The log file will be attached.

Third I connected to crash-reports.mozilla.com using Firefox, and got a blank page without content. So it seems crash-reports.mozilla.com was not working or it does not accept Firefox.

Fourth, the submission in the Firefox about:crashes succeed. 


Expected results:

"Intense ""Gah! your tab just crashed"" storms I can't duplicate","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:61.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/61.0
Build ID: 20180621125625

Steps to reproduce:

Sorry, I've never been able to reproduce one of these. 


Actual results:

Since about May 2018 I experience isolated but intense ""Gah! your tab just crashed"" storms. They only happen when I have several complex pages open in multiple tabs at the same time. I've never been able to recreate one intentionally, so I don't think it is the actual pages. It really does seem to correlate with how hard the browser is working. It does use _lots_ of system memory, but it never gets close to using it all. Close the complex tabs and it runs fine for more days. 

For instance, 
https://www.amazon.com/Sarjana-Handicrafts-Cotton-Bedspread-Bedding/dp/B072612R5R/ref=pd_sbs_201_5?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B072612R5R&pd_rd_r=V6BSK8426T4G0A1ZDKDJ&pd_rd_w=eKMCa&pd_rd_wg=0ETfI&psc=1&refRID=V6BSK8426T4G0A1ZDKDJ&dpID=51xbyO5bBBL&preST=_SX300_QL70_&dpSrc=detail
works fine today. It is a good example of the kind of page than fails - images that change in response to mousing over other parts of the content. 

A unique thing that sometimes happens is that most of a page turns black, and only a few squares of content get drawn. Mousing over black areas sometimes causes new squares to be drawn. Yesterday at one point the entire screen turned black, Windows taskbar and all - maybe Firefox put itself in full screen mode? Toggling to another app ended that. 

For another example,

also works fine outside a ""storm"" period. But it illustrates a really interesting thing I've seen a few times:

--> I've seen that several times - if Firefox is having a tab crash storm, and I give up and try Chrome, the first Chrome tab will also crash! How can that possibly happen? There has to be a clue there...

I remember the tab crashing and trying to restore itself several times, but only that one line made it into my history. I only have two crash reports despite way more attempts:

Seems like after a couple of reports it stops making them? 


Also...  If I manually submit those, the time and date change to the time I manually triggered the upload, which makes it impossible to correlate the report with what I was doing when it happened. Can it be that the actual event time is not preserved anywhere? 


So this is probably not very helpful, but the usual debugging strategies are pretty hopeless when Firefox will work fine for days and then suddenly get a storm of tab crashes that can't be duplicated. Is there some ""stress level"" indicator I could check? Some app that could correlate all my crash reports and suggest what they have in common? Something else a reasonably technical user could do while a storm is happening to help with this? 


In case it might hold clues, here is my report list. These are not nearly all the times I've seen a tab crash, lots of times the report dialog doesn't appear...

COM interceptor causes content process to crash on AARCH64,"STR (with NVDA or Narrator):
0. Build Firefox locally with this in your mozconfig: ac_add_options --enable-accessibility
1. Start Firefox.
2. Load a content document; e.g. https://mozilla.org/
Result: Content process crash!

Accessibility works just fine in the parent process, both the chrome and documents like about:support. (Note that NVDA browse mode won't work because NVDA doesn't have in-process dlls for ARM64 yet.) However, as soon as a content process tries to handle an a11y request, it crashes.

Stack:

```
(215c.26d0): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

I guess interceptor creation succeeds but then there's a crash when something tries to call it? Concerningly, this doesn't seem to even reach our code. I would have expected it to at least reach our OnCall implementation. We register the sink using COM - there's no API hooking or anything like that here - so I don't see how it could have an invalid target for the interceptor.",Other
Doing the same dynamic import in the console twice crashes the content page (or make it unresponsive),"**Steps to reproduce**
1. Go to https://dynamic-import.glitch.me/
1. Open the console
1. Evaluate the following:

```
(async () => {
  var {rainbowLog} = await import(""./cool-module.js"");
  rainbowLog(""Dynamic import in console"")

  var {rainbowLog} = await import(""./cool-module.js"");
  rainbowLog(""Dynamic import in console"")
})()
```

**Expected results**

This works fine, and I see 2 ""dynamic import in console"" logs in the console output.

**Actual results**

Sometimes, the tab crash, sometimes it looks like it's unresponsive (can't reload for example).
I don't see any meaningful logs about this in the terminal:

This happens on random videos.

At first I thought this is related to vp9 decoder, so I started using [enhanced-h264ify](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/enhanced-h264ify/) to disable vp9 and blamed bug 1570046 Today I discovered it still happens with vp9 blocked. Maybe blocking vp9 only decreases probability of this crash? Or it's caused by sound codec? Looks similar to bug 1572878 but still not fixed for me. 

I tried bisecting, and today it clearly shows me https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/autoland/pushloghtml?fromchange=d6571848ba1b4d80fac14c7fdba19caf10049b2e&tochange=f058271e55d9e9dcd472b310d2bc92048545ff72

But I tried bisecting many times already, few weeks ago, and at best I can narrow it to the second part of June, because mozregression always stopped in different pushlog range - crashes was too random. I will attach few logs.

- Discovering the issue -
This issue was discovered via I accidentally copy and pasted a full list of subdomains from another website into Firefox search bar, it crashed.
The version I used is Firefox Quantum 69.0 64 bit, I am unsure whether it still works in 32 bit version.
After verifying with my friend, I conclude that Windows and Linux both works.
I had verify it with Chrome, Brave and Opera, they didn't crash but just show address not found.
I also tested it with Nightly build and Firefox Beta, both of them crashed too.

- Steps to reproduce -
Since I haven't found the root cause for it, I'll be using the website's subdomain as proof of concept.
1. Navigate to https://pastebin.com/raw/Sb6bbGQH 
2. Copy all by using ""Ctrl + A"" and ""Ctrl + C""
3. Open a new tab by using ""Ctrl + T""
4. Paste in search bar by using ""Ctrl + V""

- Expected results -
Address not found 

- Actual results -
Firefox stopped working and crashed

- Crash reports -
I tried checking my crash report as shown in https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/How_to_get_a_stacktrace_for_a_bug_report
However it only shows InstallTime20190828152820 with the value of 1570725503 and an empty ""events"" directory.

About:support crashing when scrolling down on Fenix,"## Repro steps ##

## Extra info ##

Crash occurs here due to failing assert:
https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/652014ca1183c56bc5f04daf01af180d4e50a91c/gfx/wr/webrender/src/picture.rs#3681

It looks like the tile.world_rect.origin has a fraction, causing the assert to fail.

Another thing I've noticed is that when opening the page, the content first loads at normal zoom and zooms out once the page is fully loaded. This zoom might contribute to the fraction.",Other

Crash when browsing Gmail with accessibility enabled on linux,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0

Steps to reproduce:

* Make sure Orca is running
* Start firefox, browse and login to gmail.com
* Expand a conversation
* Make sure orca is switched into browse mode by pressing insert+a
* Press ctrl+home to move to the top
* Press orca quick navigation keyboard shortcut h until orca presents sender of a first message in the conversation

Actual results:

Firefox crashes like this.... https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/signature/?product=Firefox&signature=mozilla%3A%3Aa11y%3A%3ATableAccessible%3A%3ARowIndexAt&_columns=date&_columns=product&_columns=version&_columns=build_id&_columns=platform&_columns=reason&_columns=address&_columns=install_time&_sort=-date&page=1#reports

Guessing from the reports it's happening for stable, beta and nightly channels.
I am using Firefox nightly and I need to arrow up in the last step of my steps to trigger the crash. Other users can reproduce this when pressing down arrow: https://mail.gnome.org/archives/orca-list/2019-January/msg00376.html

Firefox 69: Tab crash when establishing a WebRTC call (CrashChannel::OpenContentStream),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0

Steps to reproduce:

We have a Web application that is using the WebRTC Framework. Up until version 68 everything works fine. In version 69 released a few days ago, the tab crashes ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" when attempting to establish the audio channel.

The offending function is:
nsresult CrashChannel::OpenContentStream(bool, class nsIInputStream**, class nsIChannel**)

This behavior is deterministic. It is happening in virtually every machine we can find, all running windows (tested with Windows 8 and Windows 10).

Additional info:
- we are using webrtc-adapter (https://github.com/webrtchacks/adapter/issues) but this doesn't seem to have any effect on the problem.
- we are using kamailio and rtpengine.

We can provide SDP/SIP captures if needed.

The crash id is bp-cc88dcbc-95da-4c95-8fae-f594d0190917

Thank you in advance.


Actual results:

Tab crashed


Expected results:

Pasting formatted text with bulleted list results in bad paste or tab crash,"Created attachment 9093643
Screenshot of copy and paste locations

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

1) Create a bulleted list in a Google Docs document with two items. It does not matter if the two items are at the same level, or if one is a sub-bullet of the other. (Here is the exact document that I can reproduce with: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ubo-ntJvXAwz3reWk_8vbjVsGJvbu4p2vUEOp4_UGg4/edit)
2) In Gmail, start composing a new email, and create a bulleted list in the email.
3) Copy the items from the Google Doc, with the start of the highlight just after the first bullet point, and the end of the highlight at the end of the second item.
4) Paste these items into the list in the Gmail email.

I was able to reproduce this on macOS on both my Nightly release (70.0a1 (2019-08-28)) and my regular Firefox release (68.0.2). I could not reproduce this in either Chrome or Safari, nor if I mixed Chrome/Safari and Firefox (e.g. copy in Chrome, paste in Firefox, and vice versa).


Actual results:

One of two things can happen: either the bullet point that you are pasting on is deleted and nothing is actually pasted, or the tab just straight up crashes.


Expected results:

The bulleted list should be pasted into the email.",Other
"MediaRecorder crashes with a space in the codecs parameter, e.g., 'video/webm;codecs=""vp8, opus""'","Created attachment 9106926
index.html

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:71.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/71.0

Steps to reproduce:

1) load attached file in firefox
2) allow webcam access
3) click the start recording button
4) wait a little bit
5) click the stop recording button
6) decide if you want to download the recording for further investigation
7) click close button to hide playback dialog
8) repeat steps 3-7


Actual results:

the first recording is a valid webm video, the second one is not

I can make the second recording work by copying the first blob from the first recording over the first blob from the second recording.

I also tried reusing the same mediarecorder object, and just starting/stopping it, but that had the same result.

Also, if I choose ""video/webm;codecs=vp8"" as the mime type, firefox says "" NotSupportedError: An audio track cannot be recorded: video/webm;codecs=vp8 indicates an unsupported codec"" and if I use 'video/webm;codecs=""vp8, opus""' as the mime type firefox crashes the tab.


Expected results:

both recordings should be valid videos",Other
Don't crash when NSS fails to shut down if we're tracking leaks,"As seen in bug 1473183 and other bugs, various leaks can result in NSS failing to shut down, and if NSS fails to shut down then we crash. This is pretty confusing for anybody looking at the failure. While I appreciate the desire to fix leaks, I would prefer if this worked within the existing leak checking framework. Unlike the JS engine's ""WARNING: YOU ARE LEAKING THE WORLD"" failure, it isn't clear to me that failing to shut down NSS is always just an indication of a random window leak, so I think it would be nice to have some indication.

What my patch does is to skip the crash if NSS fails to shut down if, additionally, the environment variable XPCOM_MEM_BLOAT_LOG is set, which is an indication that we are checking for leaks. It then adds in a fake leak, which is admittedly weird, but that should produce a failure that will turn a test orange on TreeHerder.

The failure looks like this:

Hi Team, 

I know PDF.js bugs should not be here but its a security vulnerability so i am not hesitating to file a bug over here.

Looks like a patch which was submitted for my bug 1505558 end up with a new issue. A format string vulnerability is observed in Mozilla-PDF.js.


Actual results:

Once the server is running send a malformed URI request with format string in GET or HEAD method.

curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8888/%s%s

The PDF.js server gets crash, and below is the trace for same.

STR:

1. open https://gijsk.com/temp/testdownload.html
2. open the browser toolbox (non-omniscient mode, though perhaps it works in the omniscient mode too)
3. switch to the debugger
4. hit accel-p, filter for ""handlers"" and pick HandlerService.js
5. set a breakpoint in `fillHandlerInfo` (currently around line 404)
6. switch back to the browser, click the link

ER:
hit breakpoint, be able to debug

AR:
hit breakpoint, debugged browser crashes immediately

This is preventing me debugging a security bug. It looks like an issue with the underlying network or debugging code using a nested event loop and things not working as expected. :jlast, could you help direct this to the right people please?",Other
Firefox built with GCC 10 snapshots crashes due to Rust ABi compatibility bug,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0

Actual results:

It does crash for same reason as described in https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1600735

That bug was closed by updating fuzzer from gcc7 to gcc8, but that only hides the actual problem. As co-author of x86-64 PS ABI, I could confirm that the sign extensions was not intended to be required.

I wonder if this can be worked around by changing calling interface of this function until Rust compiler is updated?

Tab crashes cause total data loss (session/URL/etc.) in all pinned tabs loaded in that content process,"Created attachment 9135310
Screen Shot of a pinned tab that happened to be in the same process as a crashed one

Twice in the last few days tab crashes on Nightly have caused total data loss (including the URL and session back/forward history) of all the tabs in that content process. This includes tabs that had been restored for a long time so it wasn't a race condition losing the URL while it's loading (there are known bugs about that). I clicked ""Restore All Tabs"" on the tab crashed page btw. I don't see anything relevant in the Browser Console.

Notice in my screenshot that the tab title is ""New Tab"", the back and forward buttons are disabled and the address bar  is blank. The only thing that remains is the favicon but I have no idea what bugs I had pinned since the favicons are the same…

Expected result:
I should never lose the session history from crashed tabs and I definitely shouldn't lose the tab's URL.

I didn't try to reproduce the problem in Safe Mode. I filed this is Tabbed Browser, not Session Restore since IMO the URL in the address bar and back/forward history shouldn't have been lost in the first place.

[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Tab data is lost upon content process crash… the whole point of session restore was to",Other

"Missing MOZ_CRASH reason in crash reports from Android, take two","This is a follow-up bug to bug 1666383, which did not fix the bug for me.

Steps to reproduce:
 1. In Firefox for Android, navigate to `about:crashcontent`.
 2. Alternatively, in a build before bug 1681842 appeared, navigate to `about:crashparent`.

Expected results:
The Socorro crash report for that crash should include a Moz crash reason.

Actual results:
No moz crash reason can be found.

Example reports:
 - `about:crashcontent` report from a build that includes the fix for bug 1666383: https://crash-stats.mozilla.org/report/index/fc1c7397-20e6-42c8-a071-702e80201210

Firefox 84.0.1 crashes in Wayland mode,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:

Actual results:

Firefox works in X11 mode, but it crashes in Wayland mode with SIGSEGV.

Firefox 72.0.1 crashes on launch on Windows 7 with no crash report/log,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/79.0.3945.88 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

Initial steps:
- Restarted Firefox when I got the auto-update popup for 72.0.1

tl;dr: Firefox 70 is last non-beta version that doesn't crash on launch without a report, Firefox 73.0b2 (beta) is the newest version that launches without crashing BUT it has other problems that make it unsuitable.

Troubleshooting steps:
- Removed profiles (Still did not launch)
- Downloaded latest released Firefox installer (72.0.1)
- Uninstalled old Firefox
- Restored removed profile (to give it something to launch to)
- Reinstalled 72.0.1 with the ""reset to defaults"" checkbox checked when offered (Did not launch; same problem.)
- Rebooted. Relaunched Firefox. (Did not run; same problem.)
- Uninstalled 72.0.1
- Downloaded and installed version 73 (beta), which launches the profile, loads all old tabs (with favicons) but fails to actually load any web content. All tabs are blank when active. Asking a new tab to visit ""google.com"" causes it to show a loading indicator in the tab but it never seems to finish loading anything.
- Uninstalled 73 (beta)
- Downloaded and installed version 70; It launches and complains the profile data is too new and there could be issues, suggesting I create a new profile.
- Created new profile and it launches a window and everything seems OK, but all my stuff is trapped in that ""future"" profile.
- Got frustrated, gave up, and opened Chrome to file bug report. :-/


Actual results:

Firefox failed to start after the update. At best two processes would launch then close after taking no more than around 1,400 K of memory. No crash reports were generated (or if they were, they weren't written to the filesystem in AppData/.../Pending or .../Submitted folders). The crash reporter app did not launch. Firefox will not even launch in safe mode by command line or shift, and the profile manager cannot be opened.


Expected results:

Firefox should have started up all the way, launching a window, and then reloading all my tabs. If it could not do that, then",Other
nightly crash with no crash report,"Created attachment 9120694
nightly.bt

Steps to reproduce:

Hi,

Unfortunately, I do not know how to reproduce the crash. It sometimes happens without manual intervention, with nightly running in the background.

The main issue I have is that no crash report is generated that I can see in about:crashes. I ran firefox under gdb and I attached the backtrace I had (takes a few hours).

This happens on this workstation (Debian 10) and has not happened on my phone nor on windows.
It also happened when I restarted with add-ons disabled.

I do not know how to qualify this better, but I usually run into this bug once or twice a day, so I can provide more info if you help me in how to get it.

Best regards,

firefox on big endian crashes tabs since 72 - unimplemented SwizzleRow in gfx::2d,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux ppc64le; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0

Steps to reproduce:

Reproduce:

1) Run Firefox 72 or 73 on a big endian system (ppc64 powermac g5 in my case)
2) Open practically any website (e.g. phoronix or twitter)
3) Website nearly fully loads and then tab crashes, restarting tab crashes it again


Actual results:

Running FF in a debugger with e10s disabled revealed why this crashes: https://gist.github.com/q66/5c7b3237069a7fc67dfc77d7d1daf6f0

Turns out the recent refactor in gfx::2d results in SwizzleRow returning nullptr (instead of a valid function pointer) with OS_RGBA on big endian. This is because on little endian this is B8G8R8A8, while on big endian it's A8R8G8B8. SwizzleRow is unimplemented for the latter case, hits an assertion in debug mode, and returns a null pointer in release mode. This is used in the gif decoder, and there it crashes.


Expected results:

SwizzleRow should probably be implemented for that case.

Working around the issue by restoring NSGIFDecoder2.cpp to what it did in ESR (i.e. avoid SwizzleRow altogether, which did not exist at the time, and put some manual conversion logic in there) makes the browser not crash again.",Other

Steps to reproduce:

Go to a WebRTC video chat website that requests microphone permission (e.g. meets.google.com or whereby.com). The actual service does not matter. It also does not matter if the permission is granted, rejected or awaiting grant. All it needs is for the permission request to have been initiated.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:80.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/80.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create a bookmark and assign a keyword (see attached screenshot).

2. Now type ""<keyword>[SPACE]<Paste HTML code>


Actual results:

Firefox will become unresponsive and needs to be killed.


Expected results:

Of course pasting such a content was a mistake. However, Firefox shouldn't become unresponsive.

(This happened when I copied something from Twitter.com while web development tools where opened. So I copied the complete HTML instead of the selected word).",Other
Firefox crashes very often when middle click scrolling (Linux Flatpak),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0

Steps to reproduce:

I am running Firefox 79.0 on Fedora Silverblue 32, via the org.mozilla.firefox Flatpak on Flathub.

When I middle-click scroll (""auto scroll""), Firefox crashes extraordinarily frequently. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens often enough that it's crashing over and over and over and over again throughout my day, always while I'm middle-click scrolling. If I avoid middle-click scrolling, it no longer crashes.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Enable ""Use autoscrolling"" in the browser preferences.
2. Load a web page.
3. Click the middle-mouse button to enter middle-click scrolling mode.
4. Move the mouse to scroll around.


Actual results:

Firefox often crashes (but not always).

When it crashes, I get the following GUI message:
""Mozilla Crash Reporter
Firefox had a problem and crashed. We'll try to restore your tabs and windows when it restarts.
Unfortunately the crash reporter is unable to submit a crash report.
Details: The application did not leave a crash dump file.""

If I run Firefox from the terminal via the command ""flatpak run org.mozilla.firefox"", then I get the following terminal output:
""ExceptionHandler::GenerateDump cloned child 1286
ExceptionHandler::SendContinueSignalToChild sent continue signal to child
ExceptionHandler::WaitForContinueSignal waiting for continue signal...

Expected results:

Firefox should scroll smoothly without crashing. Firefox should be stable.",Other
The browser crashes when viewing a page using the WebGPU,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/81.0.4044.138 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I enabled WebGPU in Firefox Nightly and tried to access the following site.
I have enabled dom.webgpu.enabled and gfx.webrender.all as Firefox Nightly settings.

Actual results:

browser has crashed.


Expected results:

I was hoping that the page would show up without crashing.",Other
./mach crashtest ignores MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH when searching for crash reporter,"STR:
- Set `MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH`, e.g. `export MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH=/c/mozbuild-temp/`
- Bootstrap so that minidump_stackwalk is installed to the above dir.
- Run a crashtest that crashes.

Actual result:
Tooling appears to look for minidump_stalkwalk in the default mozbuild dir rather than `MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH`:
```
<snip>
REFTEST PROCESS-CRASH | dom/media/test/crashtests/convolver-memory-report-1.html | application crashed [None]

REFTEST INFO | Process mode: e10s
leakcheck | refcount logging is off, so leaks can't be detected!
```

Expected result:
minidump_stackwalk is found in the path at `MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH`.

Notes:
- Copying minidump_stackwalk from the `MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH` dir into `c:/Users/Bryce Seager Van Dyk/.mozbuild` works around the issue.
- Setting `MINIDUMP_STACKWALK` also works around this, e.g. `export MINIDUMP_STACKWALK=/c/mozbuild-temp/minidump_stackwalk/minidump_stackwalk.exe`
- I don't know if this extends to other crashes not using the path, but have noticed it with crashtests.
- I'm not clear on how this is all wired so have filed against mach, but feel free to move.",Other
"If the current tab is pinned, opening about:crashcontent from  bookmark opens a new tab and it crashes instead original tab","Steps To Reproduce:

Add crash reporter for Fission subframe crashes,"Created attachment 9155788
iframe_crash_screenshot.jpg

## Steps to reproduce

1. Enable `fission.autostart` pref and restart Firefox.
2. Load https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
3. Open about:processes
4. Look for process name ""https://openstreetmap.org (webIsolated)"" and find its associated Process Id.
5. Open Activity Manager or Windows Task Manager.
6. Kill the process with openstreetmap.org's process id.

## Expected results

The user should have some way to submit a crash report for the iframe crash.

TBD whether this is the full ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" reporter (like about:crashcontent), a door hanger popup, or some other UI.

TBD whether the crashed iframe should be reloaded, show some new ""sad iframe"" icon, or left blank.

## Actual results

The map iframe is replaced with the red ""sad tab"" icon. See the attached screenshot. The user has no opportunity to submit a crash report for the iframe crash.

Even if the crashed iframe's dimensions are big enough to show the full ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" reporter, Firefox just shows the red ""sad tab"" icon.",Other

New JACK port crashes firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open serval youtube videos with firefox from Archlinux installed with JACK audio kit.


Actual results:

When I open a new youtube tab, the browser may crash depends on the number of jack ports opened.


Expected results:

No crashes. I saved serval coredumps if needed. They are too big to upload.",Other
Enabling layers.progressive-paint causes Firefox to crash,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

- Start Firefox with `$ firefox --ProfileManager --safe-mode`.
- Create a new profile.
- Enter `about:config` and bypass ""I’ll be careful”.
- Search for `layers.progressive-paint`.
- Set aforementioned setting to `true`.


Actual results:

Firefox crashes with a SIGSEGV (segmentation fault). The crashing thread seems to be the compositor thread at `mozilla::CrossProcessMutex::CrossProcessMutex`.

The defect is present in Firefox 73.0 Stable, but has persisted since at least 72.0.2 Stable. If memory serves, the bug was introduced in 72.0.2, but this is not verified.


Expected results:

Firefox not crashing. Alternatively handling the case in a more graceful manner, eg. disabling `layers.progressive-paint` on next restart or when using safe mode.

If progressive painting is deprecated, the chosen action might be to ignore the option completely, or warn on its presence.",Other

Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux mips64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0
The firefox-esr package from Debian stable


Actual results:

The tab will crash.  Not immediately, but consistently within the first minute.  

javascript.options.wasm_ionjit = False appears to mitigate the problem.


Expected results:

"Parent process crashes on arm32 aren't detected, zombie app stays behind","Steps to reproduce:
 1. In GeckoView example, navigate to `about:crashparent`.

Expected results:
Either the entire GVE app should crash, or a warning should be shown that allows restarting of Gecko.

Actual results:
The GVE app stays alive but is in a zombie state. No interaction with websites is possible any more. The app UI can still be interacted with.",Other
"In RFP mode, kkapsner's Canvas test leads to a tab crash","Someone pointed out to me that in today's nightly, one can cause a tab crash by visiting [kkapsner's Canvas test page](https://canvasblocker.kkapsner.de/test/test.html).

steps to reproduce:
1. Set privacy.resistFingerprinting = true
2. Visit https://canvasblocker.kkapsner.de/test/test.html

actual result: tab crash

expected result: no tab crash

They also added that this might be a regression from Bug 1621433.",Other
Reproducible WriteStructuredClone crash with MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT(!Done()),"Created attachment 9190080
An app with a button that crashes Firefox 83.0 when clicked.

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/87.0.4280.66 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

I made a CodePen that tries to transfer 1000 ArrayBuffers over a MessageChannel connection between a web worker and the main process. Basically, I wanted to try out the following instruction because I had a feeling that it is responsible for crashing the tab in Firefox 83.0 one of the projects I am working on.

    port.postMessage({ arrayBuffers }, arrayBuffers);

Where buffers.length is 1000. In practice any number of array buffers greater than ~170 results in the same behavior (tab crash).

To reproduce:

- Open Firefox 83.0
- Go to this pen: https://codepen.io/dawken/pen/PoGoxxN?editors=1000 (or open the attached .html file)
- Click on ""Click me!"" button
- In a few seconds, the tab should crash

Additional details:

- It does not happen if the array buffers are copied instead of transferred
- On mobile Firefox it seems to also happen when the buffers are copied


Actual results:

The instruction:

    port.postMessage({ arrayBuffers }, arrayBuffers);

Crashes the tab if arrayBuffers.length is greater than ~170.


Expected results:

The instruction:

    port.postMessage({ arrayBuffers }, arrayBuffers);

Should not crash the tab; any other browser I tried handles it just fine.",Other

simple Scratch project crashes on Firefox Nightly 83.0a1,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:83.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/83.0

Steps to reproduce:

I visit this URL:
https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/432397436/fullscreen/
on Firefox Nightly 83.0a1. This is a URL to open a simple Scratch project in full screen.
The page loads and shows a button with a green flag. I click this flag to run the project.

This message means: ""Oops! Something went wrong. Sorry, but Scratch seems to have crashed. This error was automatically reported to the Scratch team. Please refresh the page to try again."".


Expected results:

This message should not be displayed. It is not displayed when I open this URL in Chromium.

Firefox crashes in X11 when the `_NET_WM_NAME` X11 property doesn't exist.,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

Tested in v82 and the latest build as of yesterday (sorry don't have the rev).

I ran a debug build of firefox and tracked the problem down to a crash logging the error that the `_NET_WM_NAME` property didn't exist.

After setting this property in the window manager (xmonad), firefox stopped crashing.

I though it was worth reporting, to redo this run the recent firefox on xmonad with a default configuration.


Actual results:

Firefox starts, crashes after 10 seconds.

addon.zip

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:79.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/79.0

Steps to reproduce:

Use Firefox 79 Nightly to reproduce this issue.

1 - Create a new profile in Firefox in about:profile
2 - Click on ""Launch profile in new browser""
3 - In the opened window, go to about:config and set browser.privatebrowsing.autostart to true
4 - Close the window
5 - Open again the browser by clicking on ""Launch profile in new browser""
6 - Unzip the attached file somewhere on your disk, it contains the code of an extension which reproduces the issue
7 - Install the extension manually via about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
8 - Go to about:addons, select the extension (named ""Demo"") and enable ""Run in Private Windows""

The code of the extension creates a file named ""hello.txt"" and try to download it by calling browser.downloads.download. The content of the file is created when the code is run and a blob URI is used to download the file.


Actual results:

A download is interrupted. A ""CRASH""  error is displayed in the console of the background page of the extension.


Expected results:

A file named ""hello.txt"" should have been downloaded. Note that this is a regression, this extension works as expected in Firefox 77.

Thunderbird Files Contents Version 68.4.1.JPG

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0

Steps to reproduce:

I got a message from Thunderbird saying there was a new version on Jan 15.  I acknowledged that I wanted to upgrade.  When the upgrade finished, Thunderbird crashed upon starting.  Now it crashes every time I try to start it.  So, I tried to go back to the previous version of Thunderbird (68.3.1), but then it complains that the profile was created by a later version of Thunderbird and wants me to create a new profile!  But, I have 26.8 GB of data in what should be my default profile, and I do NOT want to start over and loose all my local files!  So, how do I fix this mess without losing all the data that is in the current default profile??????  PLEASE HELP ME!


Actual results:

The upgrade to version 68.4.1 resulted in a Thunderbird that is not usable with my profile, and I can not revert back to an earlier Thunderbird version because 68.4.1 changed the profile to make it unusable with earlier versions.


Expected results:

The upgrade should have gone smoothly and I should be able to use Thunderbird.  And I should be able to revert to an earlier version to run, but the profile that was altered in the upgrade will not allow an earlier version to run.  As you can see by the attached picture, there are 2 profiles showing, and both are marked ""default"", but only one file ""default"" shows when I invoke Thunderbird with Alt R at startup, and it is the newer ""default"" file that will not run with the older Thunderbird.

"With ""Bookmarks toolbar: only show on new tab"", tab-switches to/from a new-tab cause the viewport-height to change (and cause layout/paint jank) **in all background tabs**","Created attachment 9215907
testcase 1

STR:
1. Ensure you have ""Bookmarks toolbar: only show on new tab"" (this is the default)
2. Open two tabs, side-by-side. The first tab should be `about:home` (the new-tab page), and the second tab should be the attached testcase.
3. Switch back and forth between the two tabs.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
Every time you switch to the testcase, you can see that it has logged to indicate that its viewport changed height. (This height-change is from the toolbar appearing and/or disappearing while that tab is focused.)

EXPECTED RESULTS:
The toolbar-hiding-behavior should not cause the viewport of the testcase to change height.  Conceptually, the toolbar should only be present for the new-tab page; the testcase shouldn't incur layout-jank as a result of that toolbar being hidden from the tab-switch operation.

I ran into this ""in the wild"" at Google Photos -- I was viewing a large photo which is scaled to fit my viewport, and I noticed that there was a visible ""jump"" in the photo rendering whenever I switched from a new-tab to the Google Photos tab.  (It would briefly render at the smaller toolbar-smooshed size, and then render at the full viewport size.)",Other

"many empty pages when printing pages with multiple tall floats inside of flex containers (and layout.display-list.improve-fragmentation enabled, the default in Firefox 86+)","[Tracking Requested - why for this release]: Breaks basic feature (printing) on an unknown set of pages (unless one manually identifies the pages to actually print)

This is a regression from bug 1681052 which set the preference `layout.display-list.improve-fragmentation` to true. It got set back to `false` for 85 (bug 1689789).

Reproduces with Firefox 86.0, 87.0b3, 88.0a1 20210227 on Windows 8.1 with the built-in PDF export of Firefox and at least a hardware printer.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Load https://www.tagesschau.de/
2. Call the Print command.

Actual result:
Print preview mentions a high number of pages to print (between ~670 and ~5330, depending on the printer/exporter and maybe the page's changing content).

Expected result:
~25 pages as print output.",Other

Move search box to the left side in horizontal address book layout to make search-as-you-type more ergonomic,"Created attachment 9285673
Screenshot 1: Unergonomic position of search box in horizontal view

If Alex agrees, Richard could provide a fast fix for this.

In horizontal layout, having the search box on the far right just feels weird every time. 
This search will often involve names and emails, and both of these result list columns are on the far left (see screenshot). Especially on desktop computers with large screens.

Actual:
- Big distance between search box vs. most relevant result columns (Name, email): Search-as-you-type has become an exercise of repeatedly moving my head left and right [sic] to check if my search has been successful or not - not exactly ergonomic. 
- It's also way to easy to overlook your existing search filter when you return.

Expected:
- Relocate searchbox to the right side (same position as in vertical view), so that users can see and check results without twisting their head for efficient search-as-you-type.

N.B. In the old AB, at least the search box was dragged out longer so that it sort of started in the middle - alas I see no reason why it couldn't just be conveniently on the left as in vertical view.",Other
No option to show containing address book for 'All Address Books' in vertical layout,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Steps to reproduce:

I have multiple (~15) address books.

When I search for a contact  in ""All Address Books"" then the result in vertical layout does not shown in exactly which Address Book the contact was found.

Users have to switch to horizontal layout and enable the column ""Address Book"". 


Actual results:

see above


Expected results:

Address Book vertical layout should show for each contact the Address Book which contains the contact",Other

Page flashes dark on navigation with layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override=1,"Created attachment 9259844
black screen between pages

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:96.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/96.0

Steps to reproduce:

Due to issue #1749837, my theme forced Firefox to use a dark theme. Consequently, I edited the setting layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override to 1 to force usage of light color scheme.

I'm using Firefox 96.0.1 (64 bits) on Windows 10 with the theme ""furfox tail twitter"".
Problem appears without extension.


Actual results:

Multiple elements of browser's interface are still in dark mode. The search bar (Ctrl + F), the context menu (right-click), all menus (bookmarks, history, downloads, main menu, previous, next and even library window (Ctrl + shift + H)).

In addition, there is a dark screen appearing each time a page is loaded (see video attachment).


Expected results:

Normally, when forcing light context all browser should use light elements (like if I used the default Firefox light theme) and no dark screen should be see between pages.",Other

**Actual results:**

(see screenshot)
- Contact Preview: 1st column is disproportionately wide, which needlessly
  - squeezes 2nd column
  - pushes 2nd column out of view, causing horizontal scrollbar
- `Get Map` button on AB card preview gets overlaid by text content of Work address fields

**Expected results:**

- Field content should never overlap buttons
- Keep a sane with ratio between 1st and 2nd column to avoid disproportionate, distorted layout and needless horizontal scrollbar",Other

"Favicon media queries should ignore layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override, and always match browser theme","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:100.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/100.0

Steps to reproduce:

Consider visiting a page with an adaptive favicon, by which I mean an SVG file with an inline (prefers-color-scheme: dark) media query.
I use Firefox's dark theme, but have set layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override to 2 (system), as I like having a dark navbar but don't want dark mode on my web pages during the day. 


Actual results:

The favicon's media query is not activated, keeping it in light mode, on the theme's dark background, rendering it invisible (black on dark gray).


Expected results:

The favicon should have changed to adapt to the tab's background color, and not the setting used to render the page. I believe favicons should always assume a layout.css.prefers-color-scheme.content-override set to 3 (browser).",Other

New Tab Page has layout shift from article source appearing a bit later than other contnet,"Created attachment 9302749
screencast of the bug when repeatedly refreshing the new tab page, in a fresh Firefox profile

STR:
1. Reload the new-tab page, and watch the layout afterwards.
2. Repeat.

(Or equivalently: Open a new tab or new window, watch the layout, and then open a new tab/window again.)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
As the new tab page renders, the layout shifts a few times, which is a bit distracting & feels a bit broken.
The most noticeable (and avoidable) shift that I see is when the single-line domain name & reading-time-estimate appears, and the blurb shifts down (and the tile grows taller) to accommodate it.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
We should aim to avoid layout shift here. Specifically for the domain name & reading-time-estimate, we could just allocate some space there for that empty line, and populate it with text when the text is ready, without impacting the layout.",Other

Flexbox align-items causes unstable layout,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:85.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/85.0

Steps to reproduce:

See the following fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/6k79q42s/2/

I have four adjacent divs, each taking up 50% with display set to inline-flex causing two rows of divs.

Each div is identical and contains a div with ""display: flex; align-items: center;"" + a input.


Actual results:

The initial render renders one of the outer divs mis-aligned, like this: https://i.imgur.com/ZFJL7lh.png.

Subsequent renders places all the divs aligend: https://i.imgur.com/pqs3PRS.png, but I don't think that is completely deterministic. In a real world application I'm working on a similar setup jumps around seemingly randomly when other updates to the DOM are made.


Expected results:

All 4 elements should be aligned next to each other: https://i.imgur.com/pqs3PRS. This works as expected in Chrome-based browsers.",Other

firefox closes suddenly without crash (Estonian e-Residency: onepin-opensc-pkcs11.dll),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

While surfing firefox closes randomly, maybe one time in an hour.
I did not find a way to reproduce it faster.

Webrender is enabled.


Actual results:

Firefox closes without anything in about:crashes
One time there was a dialog, that an memory error occurred.
I tried debugging firefox with windbg, but i didn't see something helpful.



Expected results:

It should not close randomly.",Other
Trying to use performance devtools crashes tab/Firefox,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

I opened the developer tools, went to the Performance tab and pressed on ""Start Recording Performance"".

Afterwards, in the ""Gah. Your tab just crashed."" tab, I repeated the process, crashing Firefox as a whole.


Actual results:

After a few seconds, the tab/Firefox crashed.


Expected results:

full system crash on starting firefox on nouveau with legacy onboard gpu,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:70.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/70.0

Steps to reproduce:

os: debian sid, graphics driver: nouveau
Opening firefox, perhaps one out of 4 times will result in a graphical glitch full system lockup, with the screen being covered in colored lines. Only a hard system reset will allow the system to be accessed again.
GPU: NVIDIA Corporation C61 [GeForce 7025 / nForce 630a] (rev a2) 


Actual results:

When this happens the syslog reports one or many faults in nouveau before the hard reset. The issue does not appear to be present in firefox-esr. This is on debian sid.
adding 'nouveau noaccel=1' to /etc/modprobe.d/localvideo.conf fixed the issue for firefox 70, however this was not sufficient as I need the box for tear free video playback, which is impossible without acceleration.


Expected results:

not a full system crash. however it works as it should with firefox-esr.",Other

GPU conflict with VMWare resulting in Firefox and VMWare crash,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:

Running a game in Windows 10 in VMware Workstation 15.5.6 with 3D acceleration enabled in VMWare AND Started streaming Netflix in Firefox.

Please note that this happened infrequently with my old NVidia GTX 660, and happens more frequently with my new GTX 2070 Super. I have a monster computer, so I do not think there is any scarcity in resources.


Actual results:

When both VMWare and Firefox uses the GPU, the result is a rather predictable crash. Firefox shows the crash page, VMWare goes nonresponsive, sometimes Windows Explorer decorators, etc. disappear completely. Note that VMWare and my 200+ tabs can coexist happily, it is the Netflix (or HBO) streaming that usually insta-nukes VMWare when it starts. Unfortunately not 100% reproducible.




Expected results:

1. Not crashing the system, that would be great.
2. If you crash, please clean up GPU properly.",Other

Actual results:

(1)  Yellow error screen will open in Firefox mentioning the Widevinecdm has crashed (See attached screenshot).

(2)  You will be stuck at the Spotify support screen not being able to play music.


Expected results:

(1) Should be navigated to play lists so I could play music.",Other
TB crashes and display issues; does not happen in safe mode [@ igd10umd32.dll | nvumdshim.dll | BaseThreadInitThunk ].  HWA related,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:82.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/82.0

Steps to reproduce:

About 3 days ago Thunderbird automatically updated itself, now I see the version 78.4.0. It was nothing I did.


Actual results:

About 3 days ago Thunderbird automatically updated itself, now I see the version 78.4.0 and since then it crashes sometimes, it has issues with the interface (disappearing parts of the panels). When it crashes I see black screen and then the message that there was an issue with the display driver (Intel Graphics Accelerator Drivers for Windows 8(R) stopped responding but regained working - message). 


Expected results:

Well I would expect that the update would be an upgrade and not the downgrade",Other
Tab crash: uninitialized allocator usage,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Use the hardened_malloc allocator when running FireFox: https://github.com/GrapheneOS/hardened_malloc
2. Disable any blockers such as uBlock Origin/AdBlock.
3. Visit the following page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8981164/self-deleting-shell-script
4. Scroll up and down a bit, and wait a moment.


Actual results:

""Gah. Your tab just crashed.""

When running FireFox with verbose outputs, the following is printed in my terminal right as the tab crashes:
fatal allocator error: invalid uninitialized allocator usage
Redirecting call to abort() to mozalloc_abort

No other relevant information is printed.

Although it is technically possible that this is an issue with the allocator, based upon the circumstances and the specific error at hand, I am relatively confident this is simply a memory safety bug in FireFox.


Expected results:

The tab should not have crashed.",Other
Thunderbird 78.2.2 crashing when I try to send email from my Mac,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.9; rv:78.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/78.0

Steps to reproduce:

Just got an Tbird message when I opened my email for an update.  Loaded update 78.2.2 for my Mac using OS 10.9.5.  Used email as normal.  Composed messages and hit send.


Actual results:

When trying to send a message a window pops up (as expected) asks for password, and then the program freezes, whirling rainbow.


Expected results:

When I hit send on the first message sent after opening Tbird, a box pops up to ask for the account password, after putting in the password and hitting enter the box disappears and the email is sent.",Other
Plugin WidevineCDM crash on DisneyPlus,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:68.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/68.0

Steps to reproduce:

I did an update-upgrade for my system. 
Linux Mint 18.3, firefox Version is now 80.0, Version of WidevineCDM Plugin is 4.10.1440.18.
I went to DisneyPlus and tried to play a film.
Before the update that was no problem.


Actual results:

Since I did the update, it is not possible to play videos with DisneyPlus, PopUp says ""Das Plugin WidevineCDM ist abgestürzt"" (WidevineCDM has crashed)


Expected results:

The film is to be played.",Other

If running with -safe-mode, Firefox crashes instantly. Deleting ~/.mozilla didn't changed anything. Also tried to recompile GCC and Firefox, same results.
With GDK_BACKEND=x11 all works as expected. Firefox 77 compiled with the same options worked as expected.

Typical crash:

Standard installation of Fedora 32 workstation (fully updated)
Firefox 76.0.1 (primary browser - Downloads folder standard)
Pressing download buttons for pdf, txt, csv from websites for example https://www.pandastutorial.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/pandas-read_csv-Student_data.csv
PS: tested websites with Chromium Web Browser - no issues! Chromium downloads files without crashing the GNOME shell.

Dates sorted incorrectly as localized strings in about:crashes,"Created attachment 9149588

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:76.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/76.0

Steps to reproduce:

Open a new tab, go to URL `about:crashes` to check the Crash Reports.
Look at the `Date Crashed` column.


Actual results:

Dates in the `Date Crashed` column are sorted as a string, thus in a mm/dd/yy locale, such as en_GB, it produces unreasonable results. See the attached image.


Expected results:

Dates in the `Date Crashed` column should be sorted by the date, either from latest to earliest, or the other way around.",Other
Running AudioWorklet with Disable Cache set to true freezes then crashes browser,"Created attachment 9140037
AudioWorklet_MessagePort.zip

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux i686; rv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0

Steps to reproduce:

Set Disable Cache to true at Network tab of Developer Tools. 

Run AudioWorklet code.


Actual results:

Audio is output until eventually the browser freezes and crashes. 

A crash report was submitted yesterday. 

Attempted to take screenshots and use getDisplayMedia() at Firefox to capture thee event, however the native screenshot application began to fail and due to Nightly no longer loading Blob URL's at top level the first attempt to record the screen was not achieved. By the time attempted to record a second time the browser had crashed, and eventually had to re-install the OS.


Expected results:

Setting Disable Cache at Network tab at Developer Tools should not freeze or crash the browser when AudioWorklet is run.",Other
"Crashed on last update, lost all my tabs, history and does not remember tabs anymore","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/68.0.3440.106 Safari/537.36 OPR/55.0.2994.56

Steps to reproduce:

I had intermittent problems with TB asking non-stop for password and showing ""disconnected from yahoo server"" floating message. I had to close the TB and reopen again and it worked. That lasted for more than a year already. But it was relatively stable otherwise and I had always multiple tabs/messages opened and TB properly reopened them after restart. Yesterday it crashed.


Actual results:

When I reopened, TB had no tabs/messages opened. I tried to reopen a few again but after closing TB it opened with no tabs, empty again. In addition, it seems to wipes out local folders completely, so there are no messages there. I did not do any changes to TB (except its own auto-updates) and I did not updates my Win 7 (at all, no patches no MS updates) for the last 4+ years. The system itself is very stable.


Expected results:

I expect TB to reopen with the tabs/messages as it did for years. If that feature is gone, please advise - I will switch to another email software.",Other
Thunderbird crashes [@ DPA_DeletePtr ] when attempting to add a photo as an attachment,"Created attachment 9125820
Thunderbird Attach Problem Crash Report.JPG

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0

Steps to reproduce:

I'm running Thunderbird 68.4.2 (32-bit) version.  When I try to attach a picture from a file in a folder on my PC Thunderbird crashes.  Does it every time.   I can copy the picture and embed it in the body of the email, but I can not use the ""Attach"" button at the top left of the new message I am writing.  As soon as I hit ""attach"", it brings up the window to choose a picture, but if I left click on a folder in that pane, Thunderbird immediately crashes.   I have attached a copy of the screen before I try to select a folder.   Anything I click on in that pane causes the crash.


Actual results:

Thunderbird crashes.   I have attached a screen shot of the Thunderbird crash notice that comes up on my screen after it crashes.   Let me know if you need something else.


Expected results:

Thunderbird should let me select any folder I want, and any picture and attach it.",Other

Firefox freezes and crashes when skipping in an instagram video.,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:77.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/77.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to https://www.instagram.com/tv/CBVo2bJn-wZ/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=loading
2. Skip to the middle of the video
3. Observe firefox freezing



Actual results:

Firefox and my entire system freezes

When I skip around in an instagram video, firefox, and my entire system hangs, after that firefox either crashes, and my system becomes responsive again, or it stays frozen and i have to power cycle my laptop. Sometimes the audio keeps playing but other times it starts looping a short part of the audio.
Playing the video normally without skipping works as expected.

This was tested on an xps 13 with a Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz
And also on a toshiba sattelite c55-c-13w with a i3-4005u. Both machines are running fedora 32. I haven't changed any I tried this both with the facebook container extension, and without it in a private window.

As far as i can remember i haven't changed anything in about:config, there are a fair amount of non default settings though, but i think those are just set by fedora itself.


Expected results:

I expect firefox and my entire system to not freeze. Also if firefox freezes, it shouldn't freeze my entire system.",Other
Crashes when opening popup with AMD GPU on Linux,"Steps to reproduce:
- Have an AMD gpu
- Enable WebRender
- Open about dialog

alternative STR:
- Have an AMD gpu
- Enable WebRender
- Open extension popup

Expected result:
Dialog is opened or popup contents are rendered (a white popup shows up for extension popup - built in popups work fine too, else I wouldn't be able to even try and open the about dialog).

Actual result:
Completely freezes all graphics output.

Disclaimer: Haven't tried this with a different driver version, going to try and figure out if there's a good way to do that. The mesa drivers I'm using sometimes have bugs in them (though usually they just mean some operation is broken or similar).

Firefox crashes Windows 10 when using Google products,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:66.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/66.0

Steps to reproduce:

When using YouTube, Google Maps & YouTube TV in Firefox, it's causing Windows 10 to black screen, then reboot.

There's no specific amount of time or repro step other than to be on YouTube, YouTube TV or Google Maps and using them. After a few minutes, the screen will go black, but audio will keep playing for a few seconds more, then the device reboots. There is no BSOD, nor anything in the Event Viewer that suggests what caused it.

Note that using the same services in Chrome does not crash the machine.

Firefox 83 Under KDE Plasma Wayland Session GUI Bugged

User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/86.0.4240.198 Safari/537.36

Steps to reproduce:

1. Login to KDE Plasma Wayland session.
2. Launch Firefox after update it to 83 version.

Detail to take into account: I just upgraded Firefox to 83 and test it on another PC of mine, under the same KDE Plasma Wayland session and it worked normally, but that PC has a substantially more modern iGPU, so I'm guessing the bug has something to do with the GPU and only affecting to old GPU hardware.


Actual results:

I got sometimes a crash of Firefox, some other times it launches, but without rendering the GUI successfully, like in some kind of GUI components view or something.


Expected results:

It should launch normally, without sometimes crashing and rendering the GUI flawlessly.",Other

CSS layouterror: nth-child(even) is not calculated correctly,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:48.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/48.0
Build ID: 20160819105012

Steps to reproduce:

I have this piece of code :(ignore the missing ids)



<div class=leftnavi>
	<div class=navbutton id=userlist>Benutzerliste</div>
	<div class=navbutton id=></div>
	<div class=navbutton id=></div>

with this CSS:

.leftnavi {
  background: white none repeat scroll 0 0;
  border-bottom: 1px solid black;
  border-right: 1px solid black;
  display: inline;
  float: left;
  padding-top: 1em;
  padding-bottom: 1em;
  border-radius: 0 0 1em 0;
  padding-bottom: 1em;
}

and here comes the error : 

.leftnavi > DIV:nth-child(odd) {
	background: #eaeaea;
}


Actual results:

the ""even"" and ""odd"" DIV's are miscalculated.

The css rule clearly referes to an even or odd DIV, but instead all elements are counted, this includes the <br> elements. This leads to the situation, that the last two DIV get the same background color, which is not what was intended.




Expected results:

the <br> are not refered to, so they do not count for the even or odd calculation of those DIV's. The last and the second last DIV should end up with different background colors.",Other

"Slow layout for long pages at (nsfw) meguca.org, if you interact with page while it's loading","STR:
 1. Load attachment 8873229 (from bug 1362758)

 2. After you see some content load: click some blank space in the upper right of your viewport. (I clicked 20 times, with ~1 second between each click.)

ACTUAL RESULTS:
The page load takes much longer than if I never clicked. Sometimes it seems like the final layout (after I've stopped clicking) takes longer than it takes when I don't click at all, too, though I'm not entirely sure of that.

EXPECTED RESULTS:
Faster pageload.


Here's a profile of me simply loading the page, *without* clicking at all:

 (1) Load testcase
 (2a) Select-all
...or:
 (2b) In layout debugger, dump the frame tree.

ACTUAL RESULTS:
For 2a: The select-all-highlighting shows a bit of extra highlighted area to the right of the character -- it looks like a whitespace character.
For 2b: The framedump shows something like this:
```
Text(0)""X\n""@...  {0,0,690,1140} vis-overflow={0,0,990,1140} ...
```
Notably, there's a bogus ""\n"" character shown as part of the text-run, and we think there's some visual overflow (690 width in the frame rect vs. 990 width in the visual-overflow rect).


EXPECTED RESULTS:
For 2a: The select-all highlighting should tightly wrap the X character.
For 2b: There shouldn't be a weird stray \n character, and the framedump shouldn't show any visual overflow beyond the frame rect.
[EDIT: Actually maybe it's correct that the \n character shows up as part of the text node -- but it's still quite odd that it creates 1 **horizontal** space worth of visual overflow...]

Steps to reproduce:

Who using more than one language for typing.
Please open 2 windows.
Let's say 2 windows of:

In one window try to type in one language, and on the other window try to type in the second language.

Please switch between the windows every word you typing


Actual results:

The language is not replaced automatically, according to the language was typed before in this window.
If you switch the language, the language is kept for all firefox windows, till you switch it again.


Expected results:

It's very very annoying behaviour. You find yourself fixing the typing all the time.

Actual results:

Message layout is broken.

Steps to reproduce:

Upgraded to FF 103


Actual results:

The UI was scaled way too big, much bigger than the system UI scaling. This is using Ubuntu 20.04, all up-to-date.


Expected results:

I would have expected the UI scaling to a) stay the same as before the upgrade, and b) be aligned with the system UI scaling.

Investigation showed that layout.css.devPixelsPerPx was falsely set to 1.3333, where a setting of 1 restores the previous behaviour, which is consistent with expectations.",Other
Page shortcuts sometimes don't work when using non-qwerty keyboard layouts,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:102.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/102.0

Steps to reproduce:

There are some other related issues, but this one is very new (regression in Firefox v102).

When using a non-qwerty keyboard layout (i'm using bépo), web page shortcuts aren't triggered by the correct keys. Instead, I need to do like I was in qwerty to trigger them.

The issue is visible on Cinny (https://github.com/ajbura/cinny), Ctrl-K should open a in-page popup, but instead it opens the url bar.
It's also visible for Home Assistant (https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend), where ""e"", ""c"", ""m"" and "">"" should open a pop-up. Instead, I need to use the location of those keys in qwerty to trigger the shortcut.

It was working properly before Firefox 102 (or maybe before 101).

The browser shortcuts (ctrl-shift-i, ctrl-s ctrl-t etc) work fine.

The issue is visible on Windows 10 AND Linux (gtk).

Qwerty is NOT configured anywhere on my system.



Expected results:

The shortcuts should be triggered by using the correct keyboard layout (bépo for me).",Other
"Dialog window out of bounds, Layout","Created attachment 9283056
Floating.png

Steps to reproduce:

Using Archlinux with SwayWM (i3 compatible window manager) I installed a Add-on while Thunderbird uses one Workspace, maximized on one screen.


Actual results:

The dialog ""Add %Name? This extension..."" appears anchored to the jigsaw button with the top left corner. This positioning means most of the dialog is out of bounds, can be outside of the screen or outside the actual frame of the application. (maximized.png)

A workaround is to use the Buttons is using the keyboard shortcuts (_A_dd _C_ancel)

Even if the Dialog is not covered and not outside the view the buttons do not work, only inputs from inside the Application window work. (see floating.png)
 
While this problem might only be noticeable with windowmanagers it is a Thunderbird problem and not a SwayWM bug.


Expected results:

The dialog should respect the calculated view and place the dialog inside it.
Or:
Using the jigsaw button to determinate the dialog position use the top right as reference not top left.
Or:
Floating dialog centered to the applications viewport",Other

We Still Need Compact Layout,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:98.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/98.0

Steps to reproduce:

I still need the Compact Layout from the old Firefox, as I need my browser usable, first.

Please, also stop removing useful features, for the false god of ""Clean.""


Actual results:

Mozilla removed the compact layout without consideration of people who really use Firefox on laptop computers, with limited real estate. 

I became upset.


Expected results:

Mozilla should have added the new tablet spacing, while retaining the useful feature than many people used.",Other

Steps to reproduce:

1. Hit Ctrl+N to compose new message

Setup:
- Windows 10, Thunderbird 91.5.1 or Thunderbird 98 daily of January 27, 2022.
- Dell Vostro laptop with Intel Iris Xe Graphics. 
- Intel display driver 27.20.100.9749 of June 24, 2021.
- Internal screen is at 1920x1080 with 150 % magnification, external screen is at 2560x1440 with 125 % magnification. 
- However problem also occurs in single monitor setup (no external screen connected) at 1920x1080 with 100 % magnification.


Actual results:

The layout of the message compose header input fields is broken / very unorderly / partly cut, see first screenshot (upper part of the image)

This issue is 100 % reproducable on my setup.

Sometimes (not 100 % reproducable), when I drag the window from the monitor on which it opened to the other monitor, the issue is resolved, see second screenshot (lower part of the image).




Expected results:

Normal layout (no dark gray frame, input fields neatly placed, no cut/overlap) should be used right away and not only after dragging to different monitor.",Other

Keyboard layout detection broken in 93.0,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:93.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/93.0

Steps to reproduce:

- use a German keyboard
- visit https://vscode.dev/
- hit ""F1 -> new file""

Test:
- _type_ the following text: ""{ ""test"": { } ""
- observe that the statusbar shows ""layout: us""
- try to Ctrl + Shift + 7"" (toggle line comment): observe that is does not work
- start typing ""öäü"" (which should trigger auto-detection to switch to ""layout: de""):




Actual results:

 - observe that the statusbar shows ""layout: us""
 - ""toggle line comment"" still does not work, nor do ""Ctrl+Z""/""Ctlr+y""


Expected results:

"In grid layout with row-gap, setting on the element negative bottom-margin bigger than the element's height does not work","User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:89.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/89.0

Steps to reproduce:

1. Create CSS Grid container with some elements.
Set some gap for it.
2. Set negative margin-bottom for some grid element in container and watch what happens to the gap. Start with lower values and gradually increase margin-bottom until it becomes bigger than element's height.


Actual results:

If margin-bottom is less than element's height, gap narrows (as expected).
If margin-bottom is bigger than element's height, gap stops narrowing, instead element's height is increased to some extent.


Expected results:

Any margin-bottom value should work, element should be re-positioned according to this value.",Other
Pressing keyboard shortcut to switch keyboard layouts closes popup window for browser action of extension (Ubuntu),"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:88.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/88.0

Steps to reproduce:

I use various browser extensions that add buttons in the toolbar (browser actions) that when clicked on open pop-ups. These pop-ups often require user input using the keyboard (for example, searching for an entry in a password manager extension, or entering a description in a time tracker extension). I'm using Firefox on Ubuntu 20.10

Sometimes, while typing, I realise that I'm using the wrong keyboard layout. I might need to switch from keyboard layout to another. I press the operating system keyboard shortcut to do this, which is super+space in my case.


Actual results:

When pressing super+space, the extension's pop-up window gets closed. This is annoying, as I was intending on continuing to type. If there is already data there, that data is lost. (For example, if I had already typed a search query in the password manager extension pop-up, the pop-up closes and the existing search query gets lost.)


Expected results:

I expected the pop-up window for the extension to stay open, so that I can continue typing, using the newly selected keyboard layout. This works as expected in Firefox on Windows, but in Firefox on Ubuntu, it doesn't.",Other

Steps to reproduce:

Custom web font from Fontello

used this way

@font-face {
  font-family: 'websymbol';
  src: url('fonts/websymbol.eot?v1');
  src: url('fonts/websymbol.eot?v1#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'),
		url('fonts/websymbol.woff?v1') format('woff'),
		url('fonts/websymbol.ttf?v1') format('truetype'),
		url('fonts/websymbol.svg?v1#websymbol') format('svg');

  font-style: normal;
	font-weight: normal;
}

then classes like
.ico-help-circled:before { content: '\e804';}
.ico-info-circled:before { content: '\e805';}

that I've arranged alphabetically but do not resolve the issue.


Actual results:

Firefox complain

downloadable font: Layout: tags aren't arranged alphabetically. (font-family: ""websymbol"" style:normal weight:normal stretch:normal src index:1) source: http://...


Expected results:

A clearer information of what it wants.

Looking on the web for
""downloadable font: Layout: tags aren't arranged alphabetically.""
I found only 2 results that don't explain anything.

I don't even know where does it find properties such as stretch:normal that is not in any piece of code I'm running (searched in the entire project with CTR+SHIFT+F in Netbeans). (Maybe FF shows an inplicit default?)

What do I have to do to remove such warning? Do you have any links that explain that?",Other
[Unix] Button layout on error pages,"User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Fedora; Linux x86_64; rv:53.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/53.0

Actual results:

I've seen the Photon rework. On the error pages like [1], the preferred buttons are on the left side.

Expected results:

With the improved usage of GTK in Firefox, it would be great if the preferred buttons could be placed on the right side, according to the GTK style guideline [2] (“When a dialog includes an affirmative and a cancel button, always ensure that the cancel button appears first, before the affirmative button. In left-to-right locales, this is on the left.”). Then it would be a more consistent experience throughout the system.
